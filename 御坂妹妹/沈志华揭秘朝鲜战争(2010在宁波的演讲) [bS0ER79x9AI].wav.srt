00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000


2648
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000


2649
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000


2650
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000


2651
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000


2652
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000


2653
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000


2654
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000


2655
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000


2656
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000


2657
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000


2658
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000


2659
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000


2660
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000


2661
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000


2662
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000


2663
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000


2664
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000


2665
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000


2666
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000


2667
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000


2668
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000


2669
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000


2670
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000


2671
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000


2672
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000


2673
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000


2674
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000


2675
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000


2676
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000


2677
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000


2678
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000


2679
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000


2680
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
毛泽东是这样讲的

2681
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
说这个

2682
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
啊 金生同志啊

2683
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
说我不是不同意你

2684
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
用武力解决这个

2685
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
国家的统一的问题

2686
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
枪杆子里面出政权吗

2687
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
我就是这么干的

2688
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
啊 所以

2689
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
这个你这样做呢是正确的

2690
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
但是我原来的计划是

2691
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
你容我先解放了台湾

2692
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
等我把台湾拿下

2693
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
我把部队往北掉

2694
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
然后帮助你一块去解放

2695
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
南朝鲜

2696
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
那不是很顺理成长很容易的事情吗

2697
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
说 但是

2698
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
现在既然斯大林同志和你

2699
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
已经决定先

2700
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
这个让你采取行动

2701
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
那么我就把台湾的事情放一放

2702
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
啊

2703
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
你就先打

2704
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
那么

2705
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
请你告诉我

2706
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
现在你需要什么

2707
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
是要人还是要枪

2708
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
说那个京城

2709
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
当着苏联大使里面一拍胸脯

2710
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
说我所要的一切斯大林同志都给我了

2711
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
扬长而去

2712
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
所以毛非常生气

2713
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
而且走了以后就没消息了

2714
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
从来跟这个中国之间的

2715
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
这个电信来往就中断了

2716
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
没有

2717
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
实际上

2718
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
从现在看到的大岸文献

2719
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
包括回路的材料

2720
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
原来呢

2721
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
朝鲜人民军确实做了一个作战计划

2722
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
但是因为他们没有打过仗

2723
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
特别是没有打过大规模的这种战争

2724
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
所以他们这个参谋部设计的这个计划

2725
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
很不成熟吧

2726
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
那么

2727
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
送上去以后

2728
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
苏联顾问一看

2729
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
哎呀说你这什么计划

2730
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
你都不知道先打炮还是部兵先进攻

2731
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
给烧了扔了

2732
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
说还是我们来一个吧

2733
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
所以实际上

2734
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
真正朝鲜战争的作战计划呢

2735
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
是苏联人

2736
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
苏联顾问制定的

2737
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
叫做先发制人的作战方案

2738
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
这个整个文件已经解密了

2739
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
他就是设计的非常精密

2740
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
凌晨四点打炮

2741
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
打炮十分钟以后呢

2742
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
分七路进攻

2743
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
什么乃入打哪儿乃入打哪儿

2744
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
然后包抄汉城怎么怎么样

2745
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
设计的

2746
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
四天以后拿下汉城

2747
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
就整个这个作战计划非常严密的一个

2748
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
原来这个计划写的是七八月份发动进攻

2749
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
因为他认为这个准备时间太短

2750
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
但是京城不干

2751
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
说不行

2752
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
说到七八月份下雨了

2753
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
这个部队展开呢非常困难

2754
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
所以必须在六月份完成

2755
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
后来就定到六月二十五号

2756
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
因为那个是个周末

2757
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
说敌人不会有防备怎么怎么样

2758
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
就确定日子也确定了

2759
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
确定了以后苏联就这个军队

2760
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
因为当时呢朝鲜部队的

2761
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
苏联顾问呢是非常多

2762
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
他是从排长开始

2763
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
就配一个顾问

2764
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
排长一个顾问排长连长营长

2765
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
一直到这个参谋总部

2766
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
整个都是苏联顾问

2767
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
所以实际上整个这个战争的策划

2768
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
和准备是在苏联的这个帮助下搞起来的

2769
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
那么一切都都都做好了准备

2770
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
所以到六月二十五号

2771
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
这个大炮一响

2772
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
这个战争就开始了

2773
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
而且开始的确是非常顺利

2774
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
果然按照这个

2775
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
原来的作战方案是

2776
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
四天以后六月二十八号

2777
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
拿下了汉城

2778
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
京城呢非常高兴

2779
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
我看他给斯大林又发了个电报

2780
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
说斯大林同志

2781
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
现在我已然拿下汉城

2782
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
我准备把朝鲜政府签到汉城

2783
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
同时我希望苏联顾问团也签入汉城

2784
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
因为我们现在马上要开一个

2785
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
隆重的这个庆功大会

2786
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
电报就发过去了

2787
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
斯大林一看这电报

2788
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
非常生气

2789
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
马上给他个回电

2790
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
说京城同志

2791
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
你只是占领了南朝鲜的几座城市

2792
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
里程碼的军队都在向南逃跑

2793
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
你不赶快组织部队去追击

2794
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
你开什么庆功会呀

2795
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
再说

2796
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
我不同意

2797
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
苏联顾问团签入平壤

2798
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
我以前跟你讲过

2799
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
苏联人是不能过三八线的

2800
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
我现在仍然坚持这个意见

2801
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
所以你赶快组织部队追击

2802
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
京城一看

2803
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
哟 还得追呀

2804
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
马上

2805
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
部队重新组织 进攻会不开了

2806
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
组织两个两路军团

2807
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
沿着东西海岸线往下追

2808
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
这个时候

2809
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
美国军队参战了

2810
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
因为美国反映得非常快

2811
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
这又出了一个问题

2812
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
就是美国为什么会参战

2813
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
因为美国原来计划是不参战的

2814
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
如果朝鲜打起来

2815
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
美军是退守日本海的

2816
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
为什么战争一打

2817
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
美国又参战了呢

2818
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
其实这个呢

2819
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
我们现在看美国的档案

2820
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
其实能解释得非常清楚

2821
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
就是在四月份那儿

2822
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
因为啊

2823
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
这个我就得稍微往前讲一点

2824
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
因为美国原来对亚洲问题

2825
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
包括对中国和对朝鲜

2826
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
它是一种什么态度呢

2827
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
就是等待沉挨落定

2828
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
它不是说要干预中国的事情

2829
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
或者干预朝鲜的事情

2830
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
它有点拿不定主意

2831
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
到底该不该干预

2832
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
特别是在蔣介石一路败退的情况下

2833
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
那么到了十二月份的时候

2834
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
这个问题就已经迫在眉睫

2835
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
它必须要解决

2836
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
为什么

2837
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
因为毛泽东已经到了莫斯科

2838
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
而讲这个中华人民共和国已经成立

2839
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
那么蔣介石已经把国民政府

2840
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
签到台湾去了

2841
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
这样苏联

2842
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
马上要跟中国

2843
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
可能要有一个新的战略行动

2844
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
你美国就要表个态啊

2845
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
你到底是继续承认

2846
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
蔣介石的国民政府呢

2847
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
还是承认中华人民共和国

2848
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
你到现在再不表态

2849
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
就说不过去了

2850
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
所以十二月二十九号

2851
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
美国国家安全委员会

2852
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
就是讨论这个事的时候

2853
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
产生了激烈的争论

2854
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
那个时候

2855
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
军方的意见是不能再退让了

2856
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
想这个国防部

2857
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
什么参谋长联系会议

2858
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
认为说美军在中国军队

2859
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
一路往南下打

2860
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
美军就一路撤退

2861
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
现在就剩一个台湾了

2862
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
如果美军再撤退

2863
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
那么把台湾就让给中共

2864
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
这个会对美国在太平洋的防御线

2865
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
造成很大的威胁

2866
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
所以不行

2867
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
不能再退让

2868
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
一定要保蔣介石

2869
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
要保台湾

2870
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
但是国务院的意见不一样

2871
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:03,000
这个爱奇逊讲说

2872
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
我们现在不能从军事上看问题

2873
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
必须从政治上看问题

2874
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
什么叫政治

2875
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
你们想想

2876
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
美国的敌人是谁

2877
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
美国的敌人不是中国人

2878
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
是俄国人

2879
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
如果美国现在把他的主要的兵力

2880
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
钱财都用来跟中国人打仗

2881
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
跟中国人发生冲突的话

2882
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
那么只能让俄国人站着看笑话

2883
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
这样我们从战略上的选择就失败了

2884
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
所以

2885
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
战略的选择最重要的一点

2886
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
是不要让中国跟苏联结成联盟

2887
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
至少让毛泽东保持一个中立

2888
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
这样在美苏两个大国之间的

2889
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
就一个宽大的缓冲地带

2890
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
就不会发生美苏之间的冲突

2891
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
杜鲁门一听说你这讲的有道理

2892
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
但是你怎么不让中国跟苏联结盟

2893
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
爱奇逊说这非常好吧

2894
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
要把蔣介石卖了就完了吗

2895
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
共产党现在就差台湾没解放

2896
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
你把台湾让给共产党

2897
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
他一定敢感激你的好吗

2898
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
他这样子他就不会跟苏联搞得一起去

2899
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
杜鲁门一听说这好

2900
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
所以1月5号杜鲁门就公开发表声明

2901
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
因为来不及了你在传递信息他也没地儿传遣

2902
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
怎么就公开讲

2903
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
那会毛泽东已经到了莫斯

2904
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
搞不好他们俩就签了约了怎么办

2905
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
所以1月5号发表公开声明

2906
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
台湾从来就是中国的领土

2907
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
美国对台湾没有任何野心

2908
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
如果台湾海峡发生了一场战争

2909
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
那是中国的内战跟美国一点关系都没有

2910
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
什么意思

2911
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
共产党你要打台湾你尽管打吧

2912
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
跟我美国没关系我不参与

2913
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
他这话当然是说给毛泽东听的

2914
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
他又怕毛泽东没听明白

2915
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
所以1月12号呢这个埃及勋又发表一个公开讲演

2916
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
这讲的就更入股了

2917
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
说历史上中美就是友好的

2918
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
说中国同胞们你们想想

2919
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
说我们美国人什么时候侵略过中国

2920
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
八国联军也没我们的份儿啊

2921
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
说到现在中国那么多外国租界地

2922
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
有美国的租界地吗

2923
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
没有啊

2924
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
二战的时候给中国多少援助

2925
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
是美国人给的

2926
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
他说你们想想你们丢失的东西都哪去了

2927
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
什么新疆现在在谁的控制之下呀

2928
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
外蒙古是怎么分出去的呀

2929
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
还有你们东北的150万平方公里现在哪去了

2930
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,000
所以他这个讲话讲话一传到莫斯科

2931
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
这斯大林气的说这不是

2932
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
这明白的挑不理解吗这个

2933
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,000
所以美国人的设计他

2934
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
想如果中国人能接受这套

2935
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
美国的这个暗示

2936
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
不跟苏联签订条约

2937
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
不搞中苏同盟

2938
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
那当然美国的政策是会一个样子

2939
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
相反就会另外一个样子

2940
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
但是美国人没有想到

2941
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
2月14号中苏同盟条约签订

2942
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
而且公布了

2943
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
这个一公布以后

2944
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
整个美国的战略思想就发生了一个

2945
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
根本性的转折

2946
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
这就是4月份出台的

2947
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
国家安全委员会第68号文件

2948
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
现在这个文件

2949
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
我看在学术界重视的不够

2950
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
当然有人专门研究他

2951
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
因为这个文件原本是

2952
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
是针对这个苏联的核武器爆发

2953
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
因为49年8月份

2954
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
苏联爆发了这个

2955
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
这个世报的第一颗原子弹嘛

2956
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
这样就打破了美国的核垄断

2957
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
再加上中华人民国国城里

2958
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
再加上中苏同盟条约签订

2959
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
这个给美国人造成一个非常大的压力

2960
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
从他们讨论的结果

2961
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
看美国人的认为

2962
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
就是当时的政策这些制定者认为

2963
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
中苏同盟条约的签订

2964
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
标志的什么呢

2965
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
标志的共产主义势力

2966
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
已经在欧亚大陆连成一片

2967
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
你想苏联跟中国结盟

2968
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
那不是从欧洲一直到亚洲

2969
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
整个社会主义阵营就连成一片了

2970
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
这美国的防御呢

2971
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
它就不是一个欧洲的问题

2972
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
原来冷战所谓遏制战略

2973
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
这个凯南的一些想法啊

2974
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
它遏制都是在欧洲的范围内

2975
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
它不想把这个事情扩大到这么

2976
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
亚洲这么遥远的地方

2977
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
但是现在不行了

2978
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
现在共产主义就从这个大西洋

2979
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
一直跨到太平洋了

2980
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
你怎么办

2981
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
所以必须全面围堵

2982
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
叫全面遏制

2983
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
所谓全面遏制

2984
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
按照这个68号文件的解释

2985
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
就是不能让共产党势力

2986
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
在任何一个方向有所突破

2987
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
这个时候美国的这个防御战略呢

2988
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
已经发生了变化

2989
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
因为从全面遏制的这个理论出发

2990
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
美国不能让共产党势力

2991
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
在任何一个方向有所突破

2992
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
不管你是朝鲜也好

2993
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
台湾也好或者越南

2994
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
你在哪儿突破

2995
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
它都应该在哪儿给你顶回去

2996
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
这就是68号文的一个精神的主旨

2997
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
但是时间因为非常紧嘛

2998
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
所以它没有

2999
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
我们现在看美国的

3000
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
没有形成那个实施文件

3001
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
就是这么一个方案

3002
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
怎么在各个部门海军空军去实施

3003
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
它现在还没有

3004
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
因为时间很紧

3005
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
两个月不到

3006
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
就船战争就爆发了

3007
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
所以船战争一爆发

3008
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
美国的第一反应

3009
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
就是要把共产党队顶回去

3010
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
而这个意见就是这个

3011
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
这个埃及逊体的

3012
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
所以这就涉及到美国的

3013
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
这个生育的问题

3014
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
如果朝鲜你不给它顶回去

3015
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
它在越南打怎么办

3016
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
你接不接这招

3017
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
越南打完了

3018
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
马来西亚再给你统一家伙

3019
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
你接不接

3020
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
所以它说现在一步都不能让

3021
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
必须顶住

3022
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
就是共产党

3023
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
现在在任何一个方向上突破

3024
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
你都要把它顶住

3025
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
这就是美国为什么

3026
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
突然决定参与超演战争的

3027
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
这个原因

3028
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
那么美国一参与超演战争

3029
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
这个问题就复杂了

3030
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
立刻就引出了一个重大的问题

3031
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
所以你京城能不能顶得住

3032
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
京城如果顶不住怎么办

3033
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
赛林是很有考虑的

3034
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
所以7月2号

3035
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
这个罗深就找征来谈

3036
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
说赛林同志

3037
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
已经注意到美国出兵了

3038
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
不知道中国同志

3039
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
有没有做好准备

3040
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
赛林同志认为

3041
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
中国应该做好准备

3042
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
万一京城要顶不住怎么怎么样

3043
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
正来说

3044
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
毛泽东同志已经想好了

3045
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
所以我们现在已经

3046
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:40,000
在筹建东北边防军

3047
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
我们要准备集中三个军先到东北

3048
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
如果美国要是

3049
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
越过了三八线的话

3050
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
那么我们愿意出动陆军

3051
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
去跟美国人打

3052
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
但是希望苏联出动空军

3053
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
因为我们没有空军

3054
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
我们光靠陆军跟美国人怎么打

3055
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
提出了空军的问题

3056
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
这个罗深当时当然没有

3057
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
没法回答这个问题

3058
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
7月5号

3059
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
赛林直接给中央来发了个电报

3060
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,000
其中他一个很赞同中国的方案

3061
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
另外他最后答复说

3062
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
如果美国军队越过三八线

3063
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
那么苏联将出动空军

3064
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
协同中国作战

3065
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
协同中国的陆军作战

3066
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
所以实际上

3067
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
苏联空军出动的问题

3068
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
是在7月初的时候

3069
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
赛林就已经有所考虑

3070
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
而且做过承诺

3071
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
这个事因为过去争论也很大

3072
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
俄国学者说没这回事

3073
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
中国学者就说

3074
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
后来赛林出了反尔

3075
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
俄国学者说没有

3076
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
从现在当案解密的情况看

3077
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
赛林7月5号确实是

3078
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
给中央来打过这个电报

3079
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
那么从这以后的情况

3080
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
它大体上是这样

3081
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
开始这个朝鲜人民军要进展

3082
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
这是很顺利

3083
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
但是到了8月份的时候

3084
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
因为美国人开始

3085
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
它确实部队调动不过来

3086
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
美国在日本一共就四个师

3087
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
所以它开始只能靠空军封炸

3088
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
最少派了一个赢的先前队

3089
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
在大田招路

3090
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
结果全军覆没

3091
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
你想那朝鲜人民军

3092
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
就人海战术像浪一样的滑

3093
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
就往南滚

3094
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
你是一个赢

3095
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
跳伞下来

3096
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
那不全给卷里头了

3097
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
所以一直退

3098
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
退到什么呢

3099
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
退到洛东江

3100
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
就是大概到了整个朝鲜半岛

3101
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
南端这个地方

3102
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
慢慢的才稳住脚

3103
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
而这个时候美军的登陆

3104
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
才开始实施

3105
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
它都有个准备过程

3106
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
所以在这个时候

3107
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
京城就感到很

3108
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
就很没有把握了

3109
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
我看有一封电报

3110
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
大概在8月初的时候吧

3111
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
因为这个朝鲜人民军

3112
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
它没有经历过

3113
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
这样现代化的战争

3114
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
所以那个飞机一轰炸

3115
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
整个部队全乱了

3116
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
京城就给赛林发了个电报

3117
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
要求苏联顾问必须南下

3118
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
说你这个苏联顾问不南下

3119
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
我这个战争没法打了已经

3120
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
那后来斯大林还是答应

3121
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
虽然斯大林很不满意

3122
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
施地克夫就首先答应了

3123
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
京城这个要求

3124
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
但是他也没办法

3125
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
他也知道如果苏联顾问要不南下的话

3126
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
京城的部队真的就乱了

3127
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
但是他就提了一条

3128
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
说这个可以派顾问去

3129
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
但是把军装全脱了

3130
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
你们谁到南朝鲜去

3131
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
都算是真理报的记者

3132
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
是你们自愿去的

3133
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
跟政府没关系

3134
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
然后他又跟斯利克夫

3135
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
打了个专门写了一段

3136
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
说这个事就你个人负责

3137
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
他们死了没关系

3138
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
你不能让他们落在美国人手里

3139
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
他主要是不想

3140
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
斯大林不想留下一点痕迹

3141
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
就是苏联在参与这场战争

3142
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
我还看一个电报很有意思

3143
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
他不是援助北朝鲜一艘军舰

3144
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
所以这苏联人就开着军舰

3145
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
就进了港口了

3146
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
进完了人就要走

3147
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
京城不让走

3148
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
说你不能走

3149
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
你们走了

3150
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
我们怎么没人会开着军舰了

3151
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
给斯大林发一电报

3152
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
说您能不能把领航员

3153
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
驾驶员都给我留下

3154
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
要不然你们走了

3155
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
我们这军舰等于没人开没用吗

3156
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
斯大林回电

3157
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
不行

3158
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
说我可以帮你训练驾驶员

3159
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
什么领航员

3160
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
但是苏联的人员必须撤回

3161
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
他不能参与战斗

3162
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
包括汽车也是

3163
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
一次给了苏联

3164
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
给了朝鲜3000辆汽车

3165
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
朝鲜没那么多司机

3166
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
说跟苏联要司机

3167
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
斯大林也是

3168
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
说我可以帮你办个假效

3169
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
司机没有

3170
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
后来又找中国人要

3171
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
这是从东北派离大批司机过去

3172
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
所以当时斯大林的想法

3173
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
就是避免让美国人

3174
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
不是让苏联人

3175
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
给美国留下借口

3176
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
口识

3177
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
京城就有些怨气

3178
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
所以他就跟这个

3179
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
实际科副家

3180
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
说苏联人也不帮我

3181
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
那么应该让中国人来帮我

3182
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
说既然美国都出兵了

3183
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
美国人可以帮助旅程晚

3184
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
为什么中国人不能帮助我呢

3185
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
毛泽东也提出这个问题了

3186
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
毛其实从7月份开始

3187
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
就想把部队派过去

3188
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
从我们现在看到中国的

3189
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
大约文献和俄国的大约文献

3190
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
两边一对比

3191
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
他至少有三次提出这个问题

3192
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:45,000
当时中国的设想是这样子的

3193
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
全部换成

3194
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
朝鲜人民军的军装

3195
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
我在俄国大约里

3196
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
因为我还专门看了那么一段

3197
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
他讲的就是

3198
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
我们要的人民军的致服的样板

3199
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
什么时候给我们发过来

3200
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
急需

3201
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
因为他要把整个换成朝鲜装过去

3202
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
所以他本来的设想是

3203
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
把几个军的部队全部

3204
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
变成朝鲜人就过去

3205
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
这样反正打完就完了

3206
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
特别是到了8月份

3207
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
8月份在骆东江

3208
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
战争就处于交织状态

3209
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
他们也打不过去

3210
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
谁也反攻不过来

3211
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
这样子毛泽东就非常担心

3212
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
所以他给京城

3213
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
通过中国的联络官

3214
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
叫柴军

3215
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
后来的柴成文

3216
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
转告京城

3217
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
你这样子现在非常危险

3218
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
也通过苏联大使转告

3219
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
几条路线渠道

3220
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
告诉我

3221
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
因为朝鲜是一个狭长的岛国

3222
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
两边随时可以

3223
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
美国军可以从侧后登陆

3224
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
如果一旦被切断后方的话

3225
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
整个全军就完蛋了

3226
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
所以你要用重兵来防守东西海岸线

3227
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
但是我知道你现在抽不出重兵了

3228
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
他我有

3229
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
中国军队可以换上朝鲜的服装过去

3230
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
帮你守后方

3231
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
你呢

3232
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
在前边打

3233
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
京城觉得这个想法非常好

3234
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
所以他就找尸体科夫

3235
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
你请示一下斯大林同志

3236
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
说我们现在就想让中国出兵

3237
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
结果过了好几天

3238
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
他追问说莫斯科没答复这事

3239
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
没答复吗

3240
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
他就不敢动

3241
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
就这样子

3242
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
就拖拖拖

3243
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
一下就拖到9月份

3244
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
当时毛都跟

3245
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
有一封电报说的都非常明确了

3246
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
毛电报甚至说

3247
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
美国登陆的地点很可能就在人川

3248
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
或者原山

3249
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
都在三八县附近的

3250
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
一个西海

3251
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
一个东海

3252
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
两个港口

3253
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
说你要特别防止这个

3254
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
当时京城做不到

3255
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
那么

3256
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
斯大林后来给他一个回电

3257
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
第二次他

3258
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
京城又要求中国出兵的时候

3259
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
斯大林给了个回电

3260
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
说你主要靠自己的力量

3261
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
现在你不要老指望别人

3262
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
我再给你点飞机和

3263
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
什么大炮

3264
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
什么给你装备再给你一些

3265
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
这样就把它给稳住了

3266
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
但是

3267
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
9月15号

3268
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
美国果然就人川登陆

3269
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
一举成功

3270
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
因为人川那个地方

3271
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
他确实是不容易登陆成功的

3272
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
我到那去专门去考察过

3273
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,000
人川那个港外海水非常浅

3274
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
一年

3275
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
三次四次藏大潮的时候

3276
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
那船才能靠岸

3277
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
还靠不了

3278
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
整个大岸

3279
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
它得靠岳尾岛

3280
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
然后换小船再登陆

3281
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
而这个藏潮的时间

3282
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
两个小时

3283
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
所以两个小时

3284
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
如果你要没有登陆成功的话

3285
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
潮水一退

3286
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
你所有的军舰就搁浅在那

3287
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
那足够让人打半年的

3288
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
所以美国国防部没有一个人

3289
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
同意麦卡色的计划

3290
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
说你这不是玩命吗

3291
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
你这胡来啊

3292
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
但是麦卡色那人当时很牛

3293
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
谁的话都不听

3294
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
结果还就让他懵着了

3295
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
按着美国的战士书上讲

3296
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
人船这个地方登陆想要成功

3297
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
偷袭成功

3298
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
五千分之一的比率

3299
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
就让麦卡色堵着了

3300
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
9月15号

3301
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
美国人是七万人

3302
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
两百多艘大小舰船

3303
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
在人船登陆

3304
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
进城防守的人不到两个营

3305
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
你想两个小时

3306
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
二十分钟就被打跑了

3307
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
那么人船登陆一成功以后

3308
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
立即举施就完全变了

3309
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
美国人马上兵分两路

3310
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
一部分包围了汉城向北

3311
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
一部分南下就把骆东江

3312
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
围困釜山的朝鲜人民军

3313
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
全部给包围了

3314
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
这形势就非常危机了

3315
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
所以9月17号征来

3316
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
紧急召见这个朝鲜大使

3317
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
说现在情况已经非常危机

3318
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
如果朝鲜政府有什么要求

3319
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
马上提出来

3320
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
我们立刻做

3321
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
意思就是要出兵了

3322
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
这会儿

3323
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
刘少奇

3324
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
也传递了相应的信息

3325
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
所以到20号的时候

3326
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
朝鲜劳动党政治局就开会

3327
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
说怎么办

3328
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
说到底是让不让

3329
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
请不请中国来出兵

3330
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
清晨说

3331
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
这事还得问斯大林

3332
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
说如果斯大林同志不同意

3333
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
咱们也不敢私自作主

3334
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
当时斯大林会不高兴

3335
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
你讲

3336
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
你要人给人

3337
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
要枪给枪

3338
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
要炮给炮

3339
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
什么我都给你了

3340
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
最后你自己私自

3341
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
要找中国人帮忙

3342
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
这算怎么回事

3343
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
所以不行

3344
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
还得请示

3345
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
又找

3346
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
实际科夫说

3347
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
赶快请示

3348
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
这是情势危机

3349
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
你得给我个答复

3350
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
你到底是怎么着

3351
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
因为斯大林一直没有答复

3352
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
他前面请示了好几回了

3353
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
这次斯大林给答复

3354
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:40,000
9月24号斯大林回殿

3355
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
说这个

3356
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:48,000
现在朝鲜

3357
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
京城和朝鲜劳动党

3358
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
主要的任务就是要坚持

3359
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
革命最重要的事情就是坚持

3360
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
说这点困难算什么

3361
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
说20年代有14个国家干涉俄国

3362
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
我们就是因为坚持

3363
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
所以我们战胜了敌人

3364
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
所以你要发扬革命

3365
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
无产阶级精神

3366
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
什么大无畏的

3367
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
什么你只要坚持下去

3368
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
胜利中国是你的

3369
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
这个精神一看

3370
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
这明白了吗

3371
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
还是不让中国人出兵

3372
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
不让我坚持

3373
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
得

3374
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
大家开会说不行

3375
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
还是不能让中国参与这事

3376
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
这都到了什么时候了

3377
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
都到了9月27号

3378
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
9月27号的汉城

3379
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
已经被重重包围

3380
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
而南方的战事

3381
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
在平壤是一点消息都没有

3382
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
整个连续中断

3383
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
根本不知道南方发生什么

3384
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
后来逃回来一些部队说

3385
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
整个已经部队全部被瓦解了

3386
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
所以他面临着很重大的一个危机

3387
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
就是如果这个时候美韩联军

3388
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
要是北上的话

3389
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
三八线没有一兵一卒防守

3390
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
他部队全派去了

3391
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
没了

3392
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
所以他们又开会商量

3393
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
9月29号

3394
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
说到底怎么办

3395
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
这个不行

3396
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
如果这样子咱们就看着王国了

3397
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
所以这个金城

3398
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
又给斯安林写了一封亲笔信

3399
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
因为他原来请求这个事

3400
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
都是通过苏联大使亲笔写了封信

3401
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
讲斯安林同志

3402
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
为了国际无产阶级的利益

3403
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜劳动人民

3404
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
什么留进了最后一滴血

3405
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
坚持奋斗

3406
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
现在实在坚持不下去了

3407
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
我们希望

3408
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
苏联在这个关键的时候

3409
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
给我们以直接的军事援助

3410
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,000
如果你认为苏联出兵不合适的话

3411
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
那么请你帮助我们

3412
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
组织一支国际志愿部队

3413
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
金日成

3414
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
电报发出去了

3415
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
30号

3416
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
斯安林接到电报

3417
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
10月1号斯安林回店

3418
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
这是直接给金日成回的电

3419
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
金日成同志

3420
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
最近我在南方疗养

3421
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
你们那里发生了什么事情

3422
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
我不太清楚

3423
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
看来现在真是

3424
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
你是真的是遇到困难了

3425
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
但是我以前跟你说过

3426
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
真的出了问题

3427
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
苏联是帮不上忙的

3428
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,000
我认为现在最好的办法

3429
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
是请中国人出来帮你

3430
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
这个问题你不用着急

3431
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
我会跟毛泽东谈的

3432
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
发给电报会

3433
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
金城一接到电报知道了

3434
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
所以联业亲笔

3435
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
就给毛泽东写了一封求援信

3436
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
现在这个信就在北京军博渣览

3437
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
然后派这个飘逸语联业

3438
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
往北京送

3439
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
他也不等斯安林的答复

3440
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
而斯安林的10月1号

3441
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
确实给毛发了个电报

3442
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
前天也是这么说

3443
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
最近我在南方疗养

3444
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
朝鲜发生什么事情

3445
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
我不太清楚

3446
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
金日成来店说他实在坚持不下去了

3447
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
我认为你原来做好

3448
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
你说你不是说你原来都做好了

3449
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
军事准备吗

3450
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
我认为现在是应该出兵的时候了

3451
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,000
请告你何时出兵

3452
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
10月1号毛泽东正在天门城楼上解约了

3453
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
接到这电报

3454
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:45,000
那么当时他只是跟刘少奇中来诸德商议了一下

3455
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
这个也是回忆录你写的

3456
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
没有文件

3457
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
因为他们在天门城楼上

3458
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,000
没形成文件

3459
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
所以10月2号的凌晨3点

3460
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
毛泽东起草了一封电报

3461
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
什么意思呢

3462
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
这个电报我们现在在建国以来

3463
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
毛文稿上给发表了

3464
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
但是只发表了中间一部分

3465
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
是告诉斯安林说

3466
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
中国同意出兵

3467
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
10月15号先出四个军

3468
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,000
然后第二批再怎么样

3469
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:28,000
这是10月2号凌晨3点

3470
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
等到了白天天亮了

3471
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
总得开会商量一下

3472
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
这个政治局扩大会

3473
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
不是书记处扩大会一商量

3474
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
大家都反对

3475
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
说现在出兵的不是时候

3476
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
该出兵的时候他不让去

3477
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
你现在让我们出兵

3478
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
这不是等着送死吗

3479
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
我们跟美国人仓促作战

3480
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
有没有什么准备

3481
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
反正大家都反对

3482
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
这个时候毛就把电报收起来了

3483
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
就没发出去

3484
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
晚上他连夜召见了罗深

3485
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
就跟罗深讲了

3486
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
书记处扩大会议的意见

3487
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
说我们认为目前出兵

3488
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
实际不成属

3489
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
中国现在很多人反对出兵

3490
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
讲了几条原因

3491
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
第一是什么中国连年作战

3492
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
现在是军队宴战

3493
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
第二是民主党派反对出兵

3494
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
第三是我们要搞经济建设

3495
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
现在不能再打仗了

3496
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
第四就是打了也打不过人家

3497
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
中国武器装备不行

3498
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
根本没法跟美国比

3499
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
出去也打不了胜仗

3500
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
打不了胜仗

3501
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
我们去干嘛去

3502
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
写这么一段

3503
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
最后毛说了一句

3504
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
说这还不是最后的意见

3505
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
我们还要开会讨论

3506
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
就告诉罗深

3507
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:13,000
罗深连夜就把电报发给了斯大林

3508
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,000
那么斯大林接着电报以后

3509
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
到5号他又给毛发了个电报

3510
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
讲的什么意思呢

3511
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
说中国不是电报说

3512
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
现在出兵不是时机

3513
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
斯大林讲说

3514
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
现在出兵是最好的时机

3515
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
说你要了解大的国际形势

3516
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
第二次世界大战结束以后

3517
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
地球主义已经是走向没落

3518
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
你看日本完蛋了

3519
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
德国完蛋了

3520
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
英国也衰败了

3521
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
法国一决不振

3522
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
意大利也完了

3523
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
现在就剩以美国人了

3524
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
只要你和我联合

3525
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
把美国人打败

3526
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
实现共产主义的日子就不远了

3527
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
那个时候你的台湾问题

3528
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
就顺便解决了

3529
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
大意电报发过来了

3530
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
发过来的时候

3531
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
这会毛泽东正在召开

3532
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
政治局扩大会议

3533
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
根据参加会议的一些人

3534
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
像念荣珍

3535
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
后来杨尚昆他们的回忆录

3536
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
来看

3537
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
还包括彭德怀的回忆录

3538
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
当时大体上情况是这样

3539
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
开始大家4号那天争论

3540
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
没有结果

3541
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
彭德怀因为来得晚

3542
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
他不知道彭德怀那会在西安的

3543
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
西北主持军政

3544
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
他不知道是让到北京开

3545
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
开这个什么会

3546
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
他以为要开发大西北

3547
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
卷了一大堆图纸就进京了

3548
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
一进中那还一看

3549
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
他不对劲怎么搞的

3550
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
大家都死气沉沉的

3551
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
他没敢说话

3552
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
晚上就回去住北京饭店

3553
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
9点钟邓小平去了

3554
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
说老彭出事了

3555
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
朝鲜打起来了

3556
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
毛坚持要出兵

3557
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
大家都反对

3558
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
说毛泽东同志让我转告你

3559
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
明天9点风泽园单独召见

3560
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
你好好想想吧

3561
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,000
所以彭德怀一夜没睡着觉

3562
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
想着主席单独召见

3563
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
肯定是让我支持他的意见

3564
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,000
第二天早上9点他到了风泽园

3565
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
一见面

3566
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:43,000
老彭你说该不该打

3567
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,000
彭德怀就把他想了一夜的话

3568
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
告诉毛泽东

3569
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
说如果苏联完全杀手

3570
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
我们也不能参与

3571
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
不能打

3572
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
如果苏联办杀手

3573
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
就是他能帮着我们一把

3574
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
跟苏联联合还可以跟美国人

3575
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
有一拼

3576
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
毛泽东一拍桌子

3577
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
等着就你这句话

3578
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
走吧上会上去吧

3579
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
拉着彭德怀就进了怀仁堂

3580
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
所以10月5号下午

3581
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
政治局的会议

3582
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
才是做出了

3583
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
中国出兵朝鲜的最后那个决定

3584
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
就是在10月5号下午的会议

3585
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
做出来的

3586
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
因为有人挂帅了

3587
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
毛泽东有坚持

3588
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
所以大家也就没有再说话

3589
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
那么以后的事情

3590
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
就是10月6号召开

3591
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
第二次国防会议

3592
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
10月8号就下达了命令

3593
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
具体分工

3594
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
什么都搞好了

3595
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:48,000
但这个时候毛泽东担心一件事

3596
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
什么呢

3597
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
就是苏联的空军

3598
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
我真的怕部队派出去

3599
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
所以司法令空军没到怎么办

3600
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
所以不行

3601
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
这事他就让周恩来

3602
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
林彪说你们俩必须亲自去一趟

3603
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
得跟司法令当面这样

3604
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
得让他当面确认这件事

3605
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
所以10月8号周恩来和林彪就上了飞机

3606
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:14,000
毛同时给司法令发了个电报

3607
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
说我们现在已经决定出兵

3608
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
但是还有些具体问题

3609
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
我让林彪和周恩来和你当面去商量

3610
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
他们已经飞去了

3611
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
10号周恩来和林彪就到了黑海

3612
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,000
他得走墨斯科转机

3613
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:40,000
结果双方一谈就谈崩了

3614
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
我想

3615
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,000
当这个会谈的过程

3616
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
现在没有文件

3617
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
但是会谈的结果有文件

3618
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
这个文件公布得最晚

3619
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:01,000
大概是07年是06年才解密的

3620
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
就是黑海会谈

3621
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
所以黑海会谈一直是个谜

3622
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
到底怎么谈的

3623
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
人都不知道

3624
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
就是靠西泽的回忆

3625
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
还有俄国人的回忆

3626
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
就当时的参与会谈的人

3627
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
现在大概情况是比较清楚的

3628
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
就上了一谈

3629
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
周恩来就讲

3630
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
中国出兵怎么怎么困

3631
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
说我们现在军力不行

3632
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
这个不行

3633
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
那个不行

3634
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
怎么怎么样

3635
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
后来斯大林说

3636
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
你究竟什么困难

3637
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
你说清楚

3638
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
周恩来说

3639
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
规定间谍两条

3640
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
第一

3641
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
我们武器装备不如人

3642
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
所以非得靠苏联的先进装备

3643
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
斯大林说

3644
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
这个没问题

3645
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
你要什么给什么

3646
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
要多少给多少

3647
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
你说吧

3648
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
所有苏联的装备随你要

3649
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
好

3650
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
这个解决了

3651
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
第二个问题

3652
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
说中国没有空军

3653
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
我们只能出陆军

3654
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
但是一定要有苏联的空军配合

3655
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
否则的话

3656
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
我们没法跟美国打仗

3657
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
天空全人家的

3658
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
你怎么打啊

3659
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
这仗

3660
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
斯大林说

3661
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
这有问题吗

3662
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
这样子

3663
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,000
陆军的准备比较容易

3664
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
你打个背包

3665
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
砍个枪走了

3666
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
说空军技术性非常强

3667
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
要不这样

3668
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
你们先上

3669
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
你们先出兵

3670
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
先打着

3671
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
到两个半月以后

3672
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
苏联空军准备好了

3673
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
自然会出动

3674
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
周恩来一听说

3675
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
这哪行啊

3676
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
说我们前面打

3677
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
您万一你要不去了呢

3678
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
两个半月谁知道发生什么事

3679
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
我说不行

3680
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
说要出动咱就一块出动

3681
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
要不然我们也推迟

3682
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
我们等你们空军准备好了

3683
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
咱们一块儿

3684
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
就打

3685
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
就枪起来枪进去

3686
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
争论来争论去

3687
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
后来斯大林不敢

3688
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
说既然这样算了吧

3689
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
我们也不出动了

3690
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
你们陆军也别出动了

3691
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
放弃北朝鲜

3692
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
通知京城

3693
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
到沈阳建个流亡政府算了

3694
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
林苗语听说这不行

3695
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
你这不因火烧身吗

3696
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
朝鲜没打完

3697
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
跑沈阳建流亡政府

3698
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
说斯大林同志

3699
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
能不能这样子

3700
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
把这个京城都留在山里大游击

3701
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
继续牵制美国

3702
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
后来炒了白炒去

3703
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
最后总研制室没有结果

3704
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
这么着

3705
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
十一月

3706
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,000
十一日

3707
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
斯大林和毛泽东就联名给

3708
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
不是

3709
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
和周盟来

3710
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
就联名给毛泽东发了个电报

3711
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
讲什么呢

3712
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
说中苏两国领导人

3713
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
经过仔细的磋商

3714
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
认为

3715
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:55,000
现在只能放弃北朝鲜

3716
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:00,000
原因是中国军队没有做好准备

3717
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
扩拾包括空军

3718
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
所以我一看这文件

3719
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
我就知道肯定斯大林起草的

3720
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
那空军又不是中国的

3721
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
什么叫扩拾包括空军

3722
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
说中国军队没有做好准备

3723
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
扩拾包括空军

3724
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
所以就怎么下边列了一个大单子

3725
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
什么老若病残

3726
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
到苏联远东撤退到苏联远东

3727
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
参与部队撤退到吉林和辽宁进行整修

3728
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
然后京城同志到沈阳建流亡政府

3729
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
什么什么

3730
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
苏联大使协助京城撤退

3731
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
最后写了一句

3732
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
说

3733
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
最后的毛泽东同志

3734
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
最后的意见有你来决定

3735
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
又踢给毛泽东了

3736
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
所以

3737
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,000
12号毛泽东接到电报以后

3738
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
沙眼了

3739
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
就本来说好

3740
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
他们我出陆军

3741
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
你出空军

3742
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
咱们一块打就完了

3743
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
你先弄这么一个

3744
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
所以连夜把那个彭德怀

3745
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
全给叫回来了

3746
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
召开紧急政治局扩大会议

3747
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
到底怎么办

3748
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
说现在

3749
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,000
这个斯大林同志决定不出兵了

3750
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
这个开始

3751
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
因为你仔细看那个电报

3752
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
你就知道毛这个思路的变化

3753
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
他是下午3点

3754
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
接到这个电报的

3755
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
当时就是

3756
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
是苏联大使来送这个电报

3757
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
说斯大林同志送了一个电报

3758
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
给您看

3759
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
当场要答复

3760
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
所以

3761
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
这个

3762
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
当场他的答复是

3763
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
我同意斯大林同志的意见

3764
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
这是毛泽东的第一个答复

3765
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
完了到了晚上9点50分

3766
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
毛泽东又回了个电报

3767
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
说我仔细考虑过

3768
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
我还是同意你的意见

3769
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
就是到晚上他还是决定

3770
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
就不放弃朝鲜了

3771
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
但是第二天

3772
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
这个政治局开了一天会

3773
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
他同样开会的内容

3774
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
我们不太清楚

3775
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
因为现在这个没有看到文件

3776
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
但结果是知道的

3777
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
这个会开完了以后

3778
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
他立刻给斯大林中文来同时回电

3779
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
他给斯大林回电

3780
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
就是说

3781
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
我们经过反复的商量

3782
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
决定还是出兵

3783
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
即使你这个苏联空军

3784
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
晚到我们先出兵

3785
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
然后他又给中文来发了个电报

3786
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
他给中文来讲的电报

3787
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
讲了为什么这样

3788
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
他一个头儿

3789
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
我们经过讨论

3790
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
觉得还是必须得出兵

3791
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
不出兵不行

3792
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
为什么不行

3793
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
他没说

3794
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
这个又是个问题

3795
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
就是毛泽东

3796
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
为什么一定要出兵

3797
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
斯大林已经给你

3798
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
一条退路

3799
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
你可以不出兵了

3800
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
他为什么还一定要出兵

3801
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
这个也是史学界

3802
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
争论比较大的一个问题

3803
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
因为这也涉及到动机

3804
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
它不是个过程

3805
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
它是脑子里怎么想的

3806
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
到了会议结束

3807
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
他就把这个结果告诉谁了

3808
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
周恩来了

3809
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
但是他跟周恩来讲了

3810
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
后面是更重要的

3811
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
他说还有两个事

3812
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
你必须再找斯大林

3813
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
第一

3814
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
他说他所有的武器装备

3815
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
现在我没法给他钱

3816
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
我没钱

3817
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
中国哪有钱

3818
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
你问问斯大林能不能作为贷款

3819
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
打完仗咱们再算仗

3820
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
第二

3821
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
你要让斯大林保证

3822
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
两个月到两个半月以后

3823
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
出动空军

3824
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
这样我们可以先出动

3825
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
但是我们改变一下做法

3826
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
你先出动

3827
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
你先不跟美国人打仗

3828
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
你找一点先藏起来

3829
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
一样等着两个月以后

3830
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
武器到了

3831
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
苏联空军到了

3832
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
咱们再跟美国人干

3833
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
先找个地方防御

3834
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
购注公事什么的

3835
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
这不一样

3836
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
所以这毛你想

3837
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
他怎么考虑这个问题的

3838
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
那么周恩来这会

3839
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
已经回到莫斯科了

3840
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
所以建斯大林是不容易

3841
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
斯大林还在黑海

3842
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
所以他就找了莫洛托夫

3843
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
谈这个事

3844
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
说主席来电

3845
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
又讲了什么情况

3846
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
然后莫洛托夫跟斯大林商量

3847
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
最后答复这样的

3848
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
说武器装备

3849
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
以贷款的方式提供给中国

3850
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
没问题

3851
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,000
而且我们还可以按半价计算

3852
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
打完仗咱们

3853
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
就算你们欠的债

3854
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
打完仗咱们再还

3855
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
第二个

3856
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
三林同志讲

3857
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
即使苏联空军出动

3858
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
也不会过亚陆江

3859
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
这中来一听就急了

3860
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
说我们是在朝鲜打仗

3861
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
你这空军不过亚陆江

3862
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
你算初战吗

3863
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
他没法跟莫洛托夫说了

3864
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
赶快坐飞机就回来

3865
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
先打一电报

3866
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
告诉毛泽东

3867
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
跟着坐飞机就回来

3868
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
17号

3869
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
毛泽东一接的电报也傻眼了

3870
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
说你这不是抗人吗

3871
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
我们在朝鲜打仗

3872
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
你的空军不过亚陆江

3873
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
你算协同我们作战

3874
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
赶快把京城

3875
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
不是把那个彭德怀又给抓回来了

3876
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
彭德怀那会四十二军

3877
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
已经天险部队已经过江了

3878
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
他当时在极安

3879
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
这个单中两个渡口

3880
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
准备渡江的

3881
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
18号再次召开政治局扩大会议

3882
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
毛泽东给十三兵团发了个电报

3883
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
就照原计划出动

3884
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,000
所以10月19号的晚上7点

3885
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
东北边方军建制

3886
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
改为中国人民志愿军

3887
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
25万人悄悄就渡过了亚陆江

3888
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
这样中国军队就出动了

3889
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
但是后来因为

3890
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:01,000
后来的情况发生了一点变化

3891
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
因为这涉掉一个苏联出兵的问题

3892
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,000
按说到这就整个出兵的过程

3893
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
长安江就结束了

3894
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
但是苏联出兵的情况

3895
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
我还补充一点

3896
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
因为这个情况很多人都不知道

3897
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
是其实我们现在看的

3898
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
苏联国防部的档案

3899
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
苏联的空军早就做好准备了

3900
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
左一道命令

3901
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
右一道命令

3902
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
什么时候哪个部队掉哪儿

3903
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
后勤的

3904
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
斯大林布置得非常严密

3905
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
但他就是不告诉中国人

3906
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
因为他那会跟毛泽东

3907
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
两人都是心里头

3908
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
都不知道对方琢磨什么

3909
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
他怕毛坑他

3910
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
毛也怕苏联坑他

3911
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
所以两人

3912
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:50,000
因为如果要了解前辈中苏条约谈判的事

3913
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
你就知道他们为什么会产生

3914
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
这种极端的不信任感

3915
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
但是中国在最后的关头

3916
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
决定出兵这件事

3917
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
确实让斯大林非常意外

3918
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
而且非常感动

3919
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
为什么呢

3920
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
因为原来毛的设想

3921
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
是支援军出去以后

3922
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
找一个

3923
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
他那个在朝鲜有个封腰地带

3924
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
就是比较好防守的

3925
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
原来想把部队安置在那

3926
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
不出战

3927
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
就在那等着两个月

3928
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
苏联的武器装备到了

3929
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
什么然后再开始

3930
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
至少呢就是

3931
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
构筑一条防线

3932
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
让他远离中国的国境

3933
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
大概军事上设想是这样的

3934
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,000
但实际上从现在我们看的那个

3935
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
毛泽东军事文稿和这个

3936
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
毛泽东建国以来毛文稿和毛泽东军事文籍

3937
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
我们发现

3938
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
中国的情报啊

3939
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
大体上都玩两天到三天

3940
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
就我们知道的那个情况

3941
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
都是两三天以前的

3942
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
所以他根本不知道

3943
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
这个平壤早已经泄漏了

3944
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
我们得到的情报是平壤

3945
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
这个宣医这个崇维

3946
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
是让那小人家早灭了平壤

3947
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
就继续往前走了

3948
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
不知道

3949
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
所以中国军队出去的时候

3950
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
他是走在那个山上

3951
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,000
麦卡瑟指挥的两军北京是走的山下

3952
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
这根本就没到这个预定的防御地点

3953
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
两边就军队就错过去了

3954
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
这彭德华一看

3955
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
又这美国人在这呢

3956
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
所以第一次战役

3957
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
实际上是遭遇战

3958
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
双方都没准备

3959
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
但是中国人多灵啊

3960
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
那美国人傻乎乎的按着军令

3961
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
该扎营扎营该睡觉睡觉

3962
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
一下被中国人抱着

3963
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
打一遭遇战

3964
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
给打懵了

3965
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
这个是什么时候呢

3966
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,000
是10月25号

3967
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
那么所以中国决定出兵

3968
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
不是宣布出兵的时间

3969
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
也就定在这一天了

3970
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
所以为什么

3971
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
实际上19号出兵

3972
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
为什么宣布中国这一天

3973
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
就是25号出兵

3974
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,000
其实不是25号是打起来的那一天

3975
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
那么他这一打

3976
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
这事情就公开了嘛

3977
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
开始当然还不知道

3978
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
因为这个麦卡萨也懵了

3979
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
说哪来的这么一股部队

3980
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
美国人特别是美国人

3981
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
他给打懵了

3982
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
不知道怎么回事

3983
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
彭德华一看很聪明

3984
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
打完仗出了军队全没了

3985
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
进了大山了

3986
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
这美国人打完说人呢

3987
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
麦卡萨坐飞机上去视察

3988
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
那会儿已经下雪了

3989
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
雪白雪一片都上去看

3990
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
这没人的了嘛

3991
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
所以他回去给这个

3992
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
国防部发一电报

3993
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
说小谷流传部队不足为患

3994
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
让部队继续前进

3995
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
好 正好就进了彭德怀的口袋了

3996
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
彭德怀是什么呢

3997
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,000
他打完仗部队全后撤了

3998
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
这个美国人他想不到这个

3999
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
中国人太鬼

4000
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
所以他这个一前进

4001
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
这不正好进了人家口袋

4002
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:13,000
所以第二次是个伏击战

4003
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
第二战役

4004
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
整个把美国人给打傻了

4005
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
那么今时的

4006
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
这个不是斯大林一看这情况

4007
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
一看中国人真的就出兵

4008
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
而且出兵就跟美国人干了

4009
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
不得了

4010
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
所以28号他就通知了

4011
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
苏联空军部队立刻腾空

4012
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
协助中国陆军作战

4013
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
所以我们现在知道的

4014
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,000
苏联空军第一次空战是11月1号

4015
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
就在安东上空

4016
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
而且第一次出战就越过亚陆江

4017
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
你不可能不越过亚陆江吗

4018
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
因为你不越过亚陆江

4019
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
跟美国飞机就没法打仗

4020
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
那美国飞机也接到命令

4021
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
他也不能越过亚陆江

4022
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
你说你看现在看

4023
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
你看美国远东空军的那个作战命令

4024
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
非常有意思

4025
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,000
他让美国飞机轰炸亚陆江大桥

4026
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
亚陆江大桥有一半在中国

4027
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
有一半在朝鲜

4028
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
他的命令写的

4029
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
你只能炸朝鲜这一半

4030
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
不能炸中国那一半

4031
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
这桥是一定要炸掉

4032
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,000
因为你不炸后勤远远不断的来

4033
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
但是你不能炸中国那一半了

4034
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
你只能炸这一半了

4035
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
真的很准

4036
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
你现在去丹东看看

4037
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
就是炸的是朝鲜那一半了

4038
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
中国这边

4039
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
这个亚陆江大桥好好的还在那

4040
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
就把那边给炸了

4041
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
这当然是孙代说一句

4042
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
我现在查的结果

4043
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
就是当时美军轰炸安东

4044
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
因为我后来采访了

4045
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,000
安东当时的市委书记高扬

4046
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
我问他

4047
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
我说到底美军是不是轰炸安东市

4048
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
他说没有 误炸

4049
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
一共两颗炸弹

4050
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
他说如果

4051
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
当时你想

4052
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
我相信他这个判断

4053
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
也可能有四颗还是怎么样

4054
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
但是肯定是误炸

4055
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,000
因为如果美国想炸你安东的话

4056
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
那早就成一片火海了

4057
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
不可能想那会空军

4058
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
根本无人防守天上

4059
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
整个天空都是美国人的

4060
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
而且他空军也不会下这种命令

4061
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
只炸这个亚陆江

4062
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
就是朝鲜那半辣的桥

4063
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
后来我看了材料

4064
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
他是为什么会发生这种误炸的

4065
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
是因为这样的

4066
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,000
如果我用我在海军航空军待过

4067
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
我知道这个飞机

4068
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:49,000
比如说这是亚陆江

4069
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
这边是中国

4070
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
这边是朝鲜

4071
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
他让他只炸朝鲜这半辣

4072
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
你这个飞机怎么飞吗

4073
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
他必须顺江而飞

4074
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
飞得靠朝鲜这半辣

4075
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
这样他才能保证

4076
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
炸弹不会偏离到中国去

4077
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
因为那个炸弹

4078
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
它是45度角往下走

4079
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
它只可能往前走或者往后走

4080
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
它不能拐弯炸弹去

4081
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000


4082
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
