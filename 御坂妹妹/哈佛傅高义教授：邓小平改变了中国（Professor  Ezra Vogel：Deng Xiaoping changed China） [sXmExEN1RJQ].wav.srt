1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000


2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000


3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I don't think Dung had a policy that some should get rich first.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I think he was aware that in a country so large with more than one billion people,

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
it was impossible for everybody to get rich at the same time.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
He knew that expectations would be very high.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That some people would think they can get ready right away.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And that they would be disappointed.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If they did not get rich quickly.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So his comment that some should get rich first was not a policy.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It was a way of talking to the people and getting them to realize that they should not expect

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that everyone should suddenly get wealthy.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I believe that when he started his policies,

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
he understood that many cadres were afraid that after the culture revolution,

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
that anything they did could be criticized.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In the latter part of the culture revolution,

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
so many cadres had been criticized.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That many of them were very cautious.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Some of them concluded that the best way to get along is to do as little as possible

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and not to take initiatives.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
鄧小平 wanted the local cadres to take initiatives to do things.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He said in Chinese,

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
希望他们敢做,我希望那个人敢做,

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
so he wanted people to take courage.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And if he had criticized every little thing,

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
they would have been unafraid.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They would have been afraid to take big steps.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So he went lightly on cadres who would find ways to get rich a little bit themselves

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
or to help their friends.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If he knew that if he criticized too much,

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
then people would not be willing to take the courage to try new things and move quickly.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And he wanted things to move quickly.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And so they did.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The way I see it is that in a period of rapid growth,

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
there are so many changes and there are so many grey areas

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
that it takes a long time for any country to go through that transition.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you look at the 19th century America,

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
when we first had big railways and we first had gold diggers and oil.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And some people got very,very rich very quickly and formed monopolies.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It took us many decades to develop rules and laws to adapt to the new situation.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
China after 1978 grew and changed so rapidly

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
that there was no way they could have clear rules in 10 years or 20 years.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It is a long period of transition from the period of rapid growth

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
to the consolidation into a country with rules and regularity.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And China is still going through that transition

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
because it has changed so quickly

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and is still not settling down yet.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I think Hu Jintao already made a serious effort

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
to deal with the problems.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
His program to develop things for the west

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
was to reduce and eliminate rural taxation

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and to help local schools in rural areas

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
was already a very important step in recognition

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
that they should now try to concentrate on the rest of the country.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Even in the late 80s,Deng Xiaoping wanted to have some policies

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
so that the wealth and progresson the east coast

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and in the big cities would gradually spread to the other places.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I think what is now needed is further not only an attack on profiteering

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and on extreme wealth

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
but a better taxation system

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
to reduce the extreme wealth

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and more regular rules about what people can do.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Japanese companies were very successful

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
in limitinghow much the president of the company would make.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And in most Japanese companies,the highest salaries

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and the lowest salariesare maybe six times

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
so that the person who is present in the company

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
is not so rich as in China.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But in China,the salaries were allowed to get much more extreme

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and the riches from buying real estate

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
speculation have just gone way too high

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and there should be more effortto tax those very rich people

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and to limit the amount of salarydifferentials

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
between the highest and lowest salary.

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Deng Xiaoping was never against democracy.

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The term "mengyu"democracy always had good meanings

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and at the time of democracy wallin December 1978

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Deng Xiaoping told the visiting Japanese

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
why shouldn't people be allowed to express their opinions?

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
They have opinions,why shouldn't they express them?

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and so for several weeks

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
he allowed people to continue to post things on the wall

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
but Deng Xiaoping felt the responsibility

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
for keeping order in the country.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Ever since the opium war,China had such disorder and confusion

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
that it was not possible to have growth.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He felt that in order for China to grow

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you had to have stability.

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And so after the democracy wall had gone in a few weeks

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
he felt it necessary to stop that

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and to have it move to another place

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
some distance away

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and the big wall in Sidan was closed down.

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
However,in August 1980

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
he gave a speech on political reform

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and in 1986he allowed Zhao Ziyang

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
to conductmany discussions on political reform.

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He was not against political reform.

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
In fact,I believe his so called four principles

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Sigijibunyanzi that he announced

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
at the end of March 1979

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
were in effort to say

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
as long as you appreciate Mao Zedong

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
as long as we have respect for the party

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and for the communist leadership

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and for the dictatorship,the proletariat

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
we can have many discussions.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So it was to put a bottom line,a decent

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and some things you could not discuss

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
but as long as you had that bottom line

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
then you can have a lot of discussion.

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So I think Deng Xiaoping

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
was never opposedto democracy in the end.

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He wanted moreand particularly to beginning

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
with more democracy in the party.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I think he shared the viewthat some of the errors

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
from the Great Leap Forward

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and the Cultural Revolution

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
were made because it was not enough

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
inner party democracy

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
because not enough people expressed

122
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
their opinionthat the policies were wrong

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and he feltthat that was not a good system

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
he wanted to find waysof promoting more discussion

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
but also of preventing things from getting out of hand.

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Deng Xiaopingin 1978

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
realized thatin preparation for

128
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
opening and reformto have fast development

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
it would be useful to haveJapanese help.

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Japanese had so much technology

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
so that in 1978

132
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
he already made a new treaty with Japan

133
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
even though Japan and China

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
normalized relations in '72

135
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
they had many issueswhich they had not yet settled

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and it made it difficultfor Japanese investment

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and Japanese technologyto come into China.

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So he decidedin 1978to sign a new treaty

139
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
a peace and friendship

140
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and thatallowedthe Japanese

141
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and Chineseto work more closely together.

142
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And when he wentto Japanin October 1978

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
he wanted to lay the conditions

144
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
for bringing new technologyinto China.

145
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He visited a steel factory

146
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
perhaps the most modern steel factory in the world

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
at a place called Kimitsu

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and that was the modelfor Baoshan

149
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
the first modern steel plant

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and the Japanese transferred new technology.

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He also visited a man named Matsushita

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Sung Xia in Chinese

153
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and who at the time

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
was the leading television maker

155
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
around the world

156
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and modern electronic technology

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
so new electronic technology

158
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
he also visited Japanese Nissan factory

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Riruchan

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and that was a modern factory

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
that already had robots

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
so he wanted that technology

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
to come intoChina

164
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and he also realized

165
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
that for all that process to go smoothly

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
he had to improvethe feelings

167
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
between Chinese and Japanese

168
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
so he visited the emperor

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and had a good talkwith the emperor

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
who acknowledgedthat Japan

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
had done bad thingsin World War II

172
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and thereforethe Japanese

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and he also tried to give very much technology help

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
to China

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and in 1980

176
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
when there was a public opinion poll

177
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
in Japanabout attitudes towardChina

178
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
78%of the Japanese people

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
had positive feelings towardChina

180
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
so that was a very good successful base

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and under those circumstances

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Deng Xiaoping felt both inside China

183
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Weihao gentlemen

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
don't argue about things

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and get down to work and accomplish something

186
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and he felt in China and Japan

187
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
it should be the same way

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Weihao gentlemen

189
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
so about those small islands

190
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the islands themselves were not so important

191
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
what was important

192
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
was the broad relationship between Japan and China

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and the building of a good relationship

194
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
so that technology and investment

195
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and finance from Japan

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
could come to China

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and he made that possible

198
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and I think that helped Chinese modernization

199
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
after 1991,92

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
because of the collapse of the Soviet Union

201
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
there was no longer a strategic environment

202
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
where the United States, Japan and China

203
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
were all allies against the Soviet Union

204
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
that had changed

205
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
so it was harder to be friends with Japan

206
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
but since that time

207
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
the tensions between Japan and China have grown

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I personally believe

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
as one who goes to Japan all the time

210
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I consider myself a friend of China

211
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I consider myself a friend of Japan

212
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I first went to Japan in 1958

213
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I've been going every year for over 50 years

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and stay there a long time

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I think the Chinese press

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
is not report accurately the situation in Japan

217
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
the people actually

218
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
have very much rejected World War II

219
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
they have rejected militarism

220
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and Japan still has many good qualities

221
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
it has high quality production

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
it has long life

223
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
the longevity of the Japanese people

224
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
is the highest in the world

225
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
it has very good educational program

226
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
it has very low inequality

227
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
it has some of the best energy policies

228
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and saving of pollution

229
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
controller pollution in the world

230
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and in my view

231
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
it is still in China's interest

232
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
to have better relations with Japan

233
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and to have in the media

234
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
more information about the actual current situation

235
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
in the Japanese public

236
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I do not look at all of Chinese television

237
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
but from what I understand

238
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
there are many movies of World War II

239
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and not many that show the ordinary life

240
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
of the Japanese people

241
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and the ordinary attitudes of the Japanese people

242
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
so I think in China

243
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
there is not a good understanding

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
of the current situation in Japan

245
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
of course there are some old people

246
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
who are still alive

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
who remember the horrible things

248
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
that Japan did in World War II

249
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I think that there is not a mood

250
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
in China to have a good positive understanding

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
of Japan

252
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and in the case of Japan

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
when Japanese reporters

254
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
report the experience

255
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
for example

256
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
when Chinese youth

257
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
through stones at the house

258
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
of the Japanese ambassador in Beijing

259
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
that those pictures are shown in Japanese TV

260
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and when the Chinese youth

261
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
through stones at stores

262
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
in Japanese products in China

263
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
that is shown on Japanese TV

264
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and when your ships

265
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and your airplanes

266
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
go near Yajidao

267
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
that is shown on Japanese TV

268
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
so that has given the Japanese

269
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
a very bad impressionof China

270
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
so now

271
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
if you do a public opinion poll

272
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
less than 10% of the people

273
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
have positive feelings toward China

274
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and in 1980 after Dunn's visit

275
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
it was 78%

276
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
so I think the situation in China

277
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
also has a big impact

278
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
on how Japanese feel toward China

279
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I think if the Japanese press

280
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
was reporting more favorable attitudes

281
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
about the daily life of the Japanese

282
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and the daily attitudes

283
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I think that the situation could improve

284
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I think in Japan

285
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
they also need to do a better job

286
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
in informing their people

287
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
about the horrors of World War II

288
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
in fact most Japanese realize

289
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
they did bad things in World War II

290
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and they know the horrible things

291
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
but they don't know the details

292
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and I think the Japanese

293
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
should do a better job

294
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I say this in Japan also

295
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
they should do a better job

296
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
of informing their young people

297
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
about the horrors

298
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
that happened in World War II

299
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
including Nanjing

300
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and in Northeast and so forth

301
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,000
he would go back to his policy

302
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
putting the 假日出 on the shelf

303
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and try to have better relations

304
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
he would want more movies

305
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
about daily life in Japan

306
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
he would want to promote more exchanges

307
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
between young people

308
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and between local communities

309
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and he would

310
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
try to change

311
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
the reporting in Chinese media

312
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
so that there are more things

313
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
about daily life

314
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and the accurate information

315
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
about Japanese life

316
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
so that they could improve the relations

317
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
after all

318
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I think he is right

319
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
that China and Japan live next to each other

320
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
in the long run

321
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
they cannot become enemies

322
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
and it is not in the interest of China

323
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
to make Japan into an enemy

324
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
so I think that many Chinese people

325
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
do not realizethat their attitudes

326
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
are encouraging more military spending

327
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
in JapanChina is worried about that

328
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
but ifthey continue their

329
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
sending airplanes and ships

330
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
to the 假日出

331
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and they continue in their own TV

332
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
so many movies about world war 2

333
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and so few about current life

334
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
then I think the Japanese

335
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
will become more military

336
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
their military expenses will grow

337
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I think more Japanese have shown

338
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
that they are ready to have high level discussions

339
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and I think more high level meetings

340
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
by leaderscould improve

341
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
it is very important

342
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and trust does not build easily quickly

343
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
but I think that this year

344
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
for the APEC meetings in November

345
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
is the time when Japanese leaders

346
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
will come to China

347
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I think it is a good time

348
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
for some leaders on both sides to meet

349
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
one Japanese leader

350
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Fukuda,Futien came to Japan

351
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
China recently and had some discussions

352
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
and Chinese son of Huiaobang

353
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Hudaping recently went to Japan

354
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I think those are very good beginnings

355
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Li Xiaolin also went to Japan recently

356
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
so I think those are hopeful signs

357
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I think those meetings should continue and grow

358
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I think those are hopeful signs

359
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It is hard to say

360
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
my hope is that the high leaders

361
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
of China and Japan, Xi Jinping

362
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and now Obama can continue to have more talks

363
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
we are beginning to have military talks

364
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
these are very good signs

365
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
but American businessmen

366
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and Beijing are now very worried

367
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
about the anti-monopoly

368
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Fundenege Lundanjuida

369
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
they understand that if China has problems

370
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
with foreign monopoly

371
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
they can take steps

372
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
we would agree with that

373
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
we don't want our policy

374
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
and our country to have monopoly

375
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
but many American businessmen

376
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
feel that that movement

377
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
is now being used to discriminate

378
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
against foreign business

379
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
to make it tough for all foreign business

380
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
and so they are not so optimistic

381
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
about the future of foreign business in China

382
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and I am worried about that

383
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
because when our Congress

384
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
makes decisions about China policy

385
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
the businessmen usually say

386
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
we want to have good relations with China

387
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
but if they become pessimistic

388
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
about their future in China

389
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
then our Congress would be less willing to cooperate

390
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
so I see both tendencies now

391
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
some tendencies at the top

392
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
they have better relations

393
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and some worries at lower levels

394
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
because some Chinese military

395
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
feel confident that ever since the opium war

396
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
they were oppressed by the outside world

397
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
that the outside world pushed too much on them

398
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and that they want to now find a chance

399
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
to get backfinding China is strong enough

400
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
we don't need to give in anymore

401
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
that attitude I can understand

402
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
but I think it could lead to dangerous confrontation

403
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
that will lead to other countries

404
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
if China tries to show they are strong and tough

405
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
then other countries will respond

406
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
by trying to show they are tough and strong

407
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
so in balance I see both tendencies

408
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and I hope that the tendency

409
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
to cooperate at the very top

410
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
by Xi Jinping and Obama

411
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and by the military beginning to have real talks

412
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
and by scholars and exchange programs

413
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
increasing understanding

414
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I am cautiously optimistic

415
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
that that side will turn out to be more important

416
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
but I see both tendencies now

417
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
when some forward more cooperation

418
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
goodwill understanding

419
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and some toward more tensions

420
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I think that in the next year

421
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I don't expect major changes

422
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
my hope is that this year in November

423
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
we can have a gradual understanding

424
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
between some high level leaders on both sides

425
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I think within five years

426
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
the chances of the relationship will get better

427
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
so my hope is that in over five to ten years

428
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
the relationship will again begin to improve

429
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and get back to the 1980s

430
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
so that is my hope

431
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and I think both sides need to do work

432
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I think the Japanese side needs to train

433
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
their younger people to understand

434
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
how bad Japan military was in China

435
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
why so many people Chinese are upset

436
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and I think the Chinese need to have

437
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
a more accurate understanding

438
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
of the daily life in Chinain Japan

439
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I think it is natural

440
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
that when you have opening of markets

441
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and opportunities

442
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
that many people will begin to think of themselves

443
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and their families

444
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
rather than the collective good

445
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I think that is very hard to capture

446
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I think in the United States we have similar problems

447
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
after World War II when we fought the Nazis

448
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and we fought Japan

449
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
we had many Americans who thought of the overall good

450
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
and not just the personal good

451
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and the good of their party or their family

452
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and there is no easy answer

453
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
but I think in China

454
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
the example of the leadership

455
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
is very important

456
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
that if the Chinese public

457
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
feel that the leadership is not corrupt

458
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
and if they feel they are working hard

459
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
for the country

460
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and that the local party leadership

461
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
is working hard for the country

462
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
then I think they are more public minded

463
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and less selfishand less egotistical

464
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and it is important for the Chinese leaders

465
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
to show to their people

466
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
that they set that proper example

467
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I think at the early stage of economic reform

468
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
people were so poor

469
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
they had so little to eat

470
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
that they just wanted to concentrate

471
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
on finding enough food

472
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and in getting a home

473
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
to their children educated

474
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and getting medical care

475
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
for old people

476
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
and saving money for old age

477
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
but once they begin to do that

478
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
then they say what is the purpose of life

479
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
what are we doing

480
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and many Chinese now are at that stage

481
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
they already have the basic necessities

482
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
for a comfortable life

483
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and they say what is the purpose of life

484
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
why are we together

485
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and they are looking for something bigger

486
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and we have the same thing

487
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
in western countries too

488
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
some people who are so busy

489
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
with their personal things

490
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
they don't think about the bigger picture

491
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and faith in big religions

492
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
in the united states

493
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
is not as strong as it was

494
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
sixty years ago

495
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
but some of it is coming back

496
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
in a very unsophisticated way

497
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
but I think people are searching

498
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
for some higher meaning

499
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and I see that in China

500
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
as well as in other countries

501
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:17,000
the idea of crossing

502
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
the river by grouping for stones

503
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
is not unique to Deng

504
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
other people said it before

505
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
it's an old such one saying

506
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and it was an idea before

507
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and even in the 1950s

508
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
China is large enough

509
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
so they had certain experiments

510
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
even in something like carrying out land reform

511
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
you try it certain places

512
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and then expand it to other areas

513
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and I remember the expression

514
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
some dian

515
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
dao xian

516
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
some xian diao nian

517
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
you try it in a spot

518
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
then try bigger way

519
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and then on a broader scale

520
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
so I think that in a country as large as China

521
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
that idea of experimentation

522
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
in a small placeis not unique to Deng

523
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
what I thinkhappened in his period

524
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
after 1978

525
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
was that he led that policy

526
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
in new directions of opening and reform

527
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
and I think that's still happening now

528
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
so even if China

529
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
passes the United States

530
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
an overall economic growth

531
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
an overall economic GMP

532
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
in a decade or so

533
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
China still has the problem

534
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
of adapting to the world

535
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
and the idea of experimenting still makes sense

536
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
China is large or small

537
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
because it has such a large population

538
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
such a large area

539
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
it's not like a tiny country

540
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
if a tiny country tries a policy

541
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
that's the policy of the whole country

542
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
but China is so big

543
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
they can still try things in certain areas

544
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
and expand to others

545
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:15,000
first of all I think the world understanding

546
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
the birth of the bubble problem in Japan

547
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
does not give the whole picture

548
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I think most of the newspapers

549
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
stories about Japan

550
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
are for the people who want to invest

551
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and so with Japan

552
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
the economy not growing much

553
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
they say Japan is a failure

554
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
things they have not tried

555
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and everything

556
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
but if you consider from another perspective

557
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
ordinary life in Japan

558
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
is still very good

559
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and now everybody has

560
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
over 90% have a good standard of living

561
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
have good health care

562
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
have long life

563
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
and have good education

564
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
and the inequality problems

565
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
are getting a little worse

566
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
but not so bad

567
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I think in other words

568
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
that Japan is not as bad

569
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
if you look at the whole picture of the society

570
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
and once China gets to a high standard of living

571
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and growth will decline

572
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
that even though growth may in say 10 years

573
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
maybe down to 3% or 5% a year

574
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
that's not a bad thing

575
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
but in the circumstances

576
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
then China needs to concentrate

577
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
on different areas

578
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
helping the poor areas

579
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
helping raise the standard

580
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
getting better health

581
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
and so economic growth

582
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
is not the only thing in the world

583
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
and I think that there are some specific lessons

584
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
but not letting the bubble get too big

585
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
the economic policy specialists can learn from Japan

586
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I think that in the late 1980s

587
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
after the Plaza agreement

588
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
the Japanese let the bubble economy get too big

589
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
and they should have managed it

590
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
but I think in many other ways

591
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Japan has managed social developments

592
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
and energy policy

593
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and employment policy in a very good way

594
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
and I think in all those areas

595
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
China still has things to learn from Japan

596
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:53,000
it's very difficult to have a policy that works everywhere

597
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
when you have a private economy

598
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
because the private economy

599
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
is hard for government to control in a precise way

600
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
but I think if the government has enough money

601
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
to give fairly good salaries to its workers

602
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
and has moderate differences

603
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
but not huge differences

604
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and then can control the private wealth

605
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
from getting too big

606
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
somemy Chinese taught me a new word in Chinese

607
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
this year, this week

608
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
too how

609
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
that many billionaires are not so sophisticated

610
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and I think that if you can put some limits

611
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
on the amount of money that those people have

612
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
find policiesand then through taxation

613
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
of those really rich people

614
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and then use some of that money

615
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
to increase the basic salaries

616
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
of salaried workers for the government

617
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
and for state enterprises

618
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
that would be a good thing

619
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I think in the 1950s

620
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
a lot of very smart Japanese specialists

621
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
realized that many workers were opposed to new technology

622
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
they were afraid that if you brought in technology

623
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
they would lose their jobs

624
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
so the leaders of the businesses made a deal

625
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
they would be open and give information

626
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
they would give a large percentage of the profits

627
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
to the workersand not just to the capitalists

628
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and those basic agreements

629
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
will work out in the 1950s

630
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I think that a great deal

631
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
to make Japanese society fairly stable today

632
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:58,000
what I try to dowhen I look at an issue

633
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
is consider the issue from all aspects

634
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
from the immediate people around someone

635
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
for the local groups were there

636
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
for the broader society

637
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
for international relations

638
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and for historical developments

639
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I try to think about each of those

640
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
and I think if you consider

641
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
start from the very broad picture

642
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
what happened in Chinese history

643
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and world history as a result of Daum

644
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and the leadership that he provided

645
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
he made it possible

646
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
for China to enter into the world

647
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
it had always in history

648
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
been a leader of Asia for several thousand years

649
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
but it had never joined the international institutions

650
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
and since the 18th century

651
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
in Europe and North America

652
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
there were gradually new international laws

653
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
and rulesand it grew immediately

654
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
after World War II

655
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Dung helped guide China

656
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
into that new world structure

657
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
he joined the world bank

658
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
he joined the international monetary portion

659
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
he laid the basisfor joining

660
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
the World Trade Organization

661
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
and China benefited enormously

662
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
from the international trade

663
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
so I think many young Chinese

664
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
do not realize how hard that was

665
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
some young Chinesethink the problems now are so difficult

666
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
but they don't realize how difficult

667
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
the things were in 1978

668
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I know some of my Chinese friends

669
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
from the left criticizeDung

670
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
becausehe did not do enough

671
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
it was a very difficult

672
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
pay between rich and poor

673
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
and he allowedcorruption to grow too much

674
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
some of my people

675
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and a lot of things to get too capitalistic

676
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
some of my friends

677
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
who are more rightin China

678
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
think they did not do enough for democracy

679
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and ifhe had done more for democracy

680
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and freedom,China would be better today

681
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
maybe they are partly right

682
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
but if you consider the broad development

683
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
if you consider China after the end

684
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
of the cultural revolution

685
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
when the society was so poor

686
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
so badly divided

687
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
the problems of bringingChina into the world order

688
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
which all the leaders Sunniatsen

689
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Junka Shek had failed

690
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and Mao Zedong had failed

691
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and he had done the leadership

692
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
that happened

693
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and he had extraordinary political leadership

694
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
so my conclusion is

695
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
that from the standard of the overall impact

696
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
of the society he faced

697
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
and what he accomplished

698
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
that there was an enormous change

699
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
that was under his direction

700
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and I did not see that any other Chinese leader

701
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
had the experience,the wisdom

702
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
the experience abroad

703
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
the experience in all kinds of areas

704
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
in foreign relations

705
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and the economy and local government

706
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
no one else had that combination

707
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
of experience and leadership

708
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
who could have guided China

709
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
at that critical period

710
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I think Chinese people were very lucky

711
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
that such a strong leader

712
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
maybe he could have done more

713
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
to make China more equal

714
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
maybe he could have done more

715
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
to make China free

716
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
those are very hard judgments

717
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
and history does not allow

718
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
hypotheses

719
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
it's either happened and so we see what happened

720
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
and I think it is remarkable

721
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
what happened under his leadership

722
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000


723
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
