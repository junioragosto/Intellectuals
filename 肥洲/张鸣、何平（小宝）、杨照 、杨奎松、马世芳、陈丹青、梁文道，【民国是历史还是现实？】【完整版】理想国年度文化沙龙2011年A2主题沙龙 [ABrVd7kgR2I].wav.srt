1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000


2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000


3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
大家早上好

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
我叫梁文道

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
歡迎大家來

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
我們第二屆理想國

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
沙龍第二天早上的論壇

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
先要跟大家說一下

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
我們昨天呢

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
我們這個論壇呢

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
這個沙龍啊

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
太嫩了

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
人數又少

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
我指的是工作人員的人數少

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
所以我們出現了很多不可預計的狀況

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
那麼昨天呢

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
我知道有很多年輕朋友

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
可能今天你在場的

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
可能是昨天都來過

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
那昨天呢

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
我知道大家排隊很辛苦

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
找票很辛苦

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
可能很多人拿到票了

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
但是進不來

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
而且昨天外的天氣也挺涼的

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
下的雨

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
排到人家隔壁國安局門口

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000


29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
情況不是很好

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
還好

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
群眾情緒相當穩定

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000


33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
可見這真是一個

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
和諧社會

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
呃

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
我希望今天大家繼續和諧

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
那麼而且我要

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
鄭重的跟大家道歉

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
我們昨天的混亂

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
犧牲掉大家很多寶貴的時間

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
呃

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
各位的熱情我們都覺得

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
不知道該怎麼辦才好

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
因為我們昨天晚上才碰到一夥年輕人

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
一起住在一個青年的那種

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
鋁舍裡面

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
哦就你們是吧又來了

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
他們那夥人

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
呃其實剛剛才認識沒多久

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
昨晚已經在宿舍搞上了

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
呃

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
包括了有河南來的

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
有上海來的

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
有遼寧過來的

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
有可能都沒辦法進來

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
我們真的覺得很不好

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
所以我們明年一定

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
會改善

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
希望能夠解決掉今年出現的這些問題

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
如果

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
明年還有的話

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
呃

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
我們就開始我們今天早上的這一場

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
今天大家知道我們的大主題是要打開

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
那我們今天早上這一場呢

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
要談的一個問題就是

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
關於民國的問題

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
我們知道為什麼要講民國呢

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
最主要理由當然

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
因為今年是新駭革命百年

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
那各地呢

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
都有很多紀念

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
新駭革命的活動

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
呃

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
種種的文藝

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
座談什麼都有

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
同時呢最近兩三年

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
我又注意到出現了一種

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
很奇怪的民國熱

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
熱到什麼程度呢就拿我比較熟悉的地方

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
我們廣東的廣州的中三大學

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
呃

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
呃他們

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
今年的畢業理上面有一些同學

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
呃

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
穿回一種他們想像中的

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
民國學生的服裝

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
就這個女孩

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
穿著一些

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
呃旗袍

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
但是是比較朴素的

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
昨天志忠雲老師才跟我們講了一遍說

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
他們當年民國女孩穿的那個

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
旗袍那個叉是不准

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
高過七蓋以上

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
各位在電影裡面看到開到這裡的

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
那種都是

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
妓女

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
或者性工作者

100
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
呃

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
為什麼現在忽然有這樣一股民國

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
熱

103
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
民國到底是個已經過去了的

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
東西

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
所以我們現在可以懷舊

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
越懷舊它越美麗

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
越懷舊它越浪漫

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
所以變成一股熱潮

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
還是說民國其實真的是個很

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
現實存在過的東西

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
先裝白孔的

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
有很多問題

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
有很多浮舊不堪的事情

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
甚至有人還說

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
現在可好台灣開放自由行給大家了

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
終於

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
很多人就覺得終於能夠去到民國的

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
土地上了

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
沒錯人家還是叫中華民國

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
但是問題是那個民國是不是我們

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
以前所認知的那個民國呢

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
那這個叫不叫一個現實中的

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
民國呢

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
所以這裡面會牽連到很多歷史的

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
政治的問題

126
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
於是我們今天請來幾位嘉賓呢

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
讓大家

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
一起來跟他們分享一下他們的

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
看法跟

130
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
他們的見解

131
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
等一下我們是這樣的啊

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
我們有一些安排先說清楚

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
我們台上每一位嘉賓大概會講10分鐘

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
講完10分鐘之後剩下的時間

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
就交給大家我們提問

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
提議件

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
最後我再給他們兩三分鐘

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
一人兩三分鐘總結

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
要先提出兩點很抱歉

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
就等一下我們活動結束之後

141
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
由於我們人多

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
而下來的樓梯入口

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
只有一條

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
大家注意到對不對

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
很容易發生的時候我們很常見的那種什麼

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Disco的才使人的事件啊

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
就是在這種地方發生的

148
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
所以各位等一下離開的時候呢

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
我們最好是從讓後面那一排的

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
朋友先離場

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
我們一排一排一排這麼出去好不好

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
那麼為了保證大家的安全

153
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
第二又由於我們時間的問題

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
跟人數的問題

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
跟場地限制的問題

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
我們今天可能跟平常不同的是

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
也許我們等一下活動結束之後

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
就沒有辦法

159
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
讓各位的朋友

160
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
來跟我們台上的幾位嘉賓

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
簽名啊合影啊

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
這是非常抱歉的

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
這是非常抱歉的

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
雖然我們今天的嘉賓

165
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
我知道你們一定有很多粉絲們

166
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
是衝著他們來的比如說我先介紹一下吧

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000

01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000


2032
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000


2033
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000


2034
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000


2035
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000


2036
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000


2037
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000


2038
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000


2039
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000


2040
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000


2041
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000


2042
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000


2043
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
他們並沒有在這段時間就真的

2044
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
成了親或怎麼樣

2045
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
那個真的是一個亂世

2046
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
我小時候一直以為他們是

2047
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
依上了案

2048
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
然後家人接到他們

2049
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
看到先打到電報說

2050
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
原來這個馬田英在日本

2051
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
已經有了太太就幫他們準備了新房

2052
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
他們就被送作堆就結婚了

2053
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
好像也不是這樣

2054
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
後來有種種的曲折

2055
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
現在回想起來

2056
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
也許爺爺奶奶那個時候

2057
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
就有了感情

2058
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
但總而言之呢

2059
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
上了案之後經過許多的曲折

2060
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
我爺爺回到中國

2061
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
後來接任了東北

2062
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
東北中學的校長

2063
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
然後帶著東北中學的師生

2064
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
一起撤退到重慶大後方

2065
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
我奶奶就沒有跟他一塊

2066
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
我奶奶就去忙別的事情去了

2067
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
去幹嘛了我也沒弄清楚

2068
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
最後他們是在重慶又再

2069
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
再相會的

2070
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
重慶節的婚

2071
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
我爺爺因為是一個科學家

2072
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
他帶著東北中學的師生撤退

2073
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
一路上碰到非常多的兼險

2074
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
我爺爺也曾經

2075
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
帶著他的學生一起

2076
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
去在打仗的時候

2077
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
去採集地質標本

2078
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
去做這個研究

2079
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
那到處都有土匪

2080
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
土匪會看到這些

2081
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
這些人

2082
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
這個帶著一箱一箱的東西

2083
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
他們就猜裡面會不會是

2084
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
經營財寶

2085
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
所以很可能會來搶

2086
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
我爺爺就知道這個會有這個問題

2087
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
所以他就每次要

2088
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
雜營過夜的時候

2089
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
就把就吩咐這些學生

2090
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
把所有的這些圓敲

2091
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
鏟子

2092
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
採來的這些畫質標本

2093
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
全部攤開來

2094
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
就讓你看到裡面不是

2095
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
經營財寶都是石頭

2096
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
然後再叫他們找鐵絲

2097
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
來圍起來

2098
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
有電危險

2099
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
土匪看到了

2100
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
不識字

2101
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
不敢輕舉妄動

2102
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
回去找他們的師爺

2103
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
師爺來看

2104
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
就說這個不能碰

2105
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
有電會把我們吸住人就死了

2106
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
所以

2107
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
我爺爺就用這樣的極致

2108
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
化解了這樣的危機

2109
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
這些故事都是我爺爺的學生

2110
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
多年之後在台大地質期告訴我的父親

2111
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
他自己在家裡從來不說

2112
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
奶奶跟爺爺在重慶又重逢

2113
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
他們才真正的結了婚

2114
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
有了我的姑姑

2115
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
就是我父親的姐姐馬俞光

2116
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
再來又有了我的父親馬國光

2117
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
到了快要生我爸的時候

2118
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
就是他我媽媽知道他已經懷了

2119
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
對不起我奶奶知道他懷了第二胎

2120
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
我奶奶知道他懷了第二胎

2121
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
那時候我爺爺已經不在家了

2122
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
也不知道到哪裡去研究地質學

2123
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
我爺爺是一個非常不顧家的男人

2124
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
奶奶不想生第二胎

2125
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
他已經大概動心要跟我爺爺離婚了

2126
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
他就寫信給我爺爺

2127
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
也不知道那個戰斷的時代

2128
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
信件往難非常的廢事

2129
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
他就跟我爺爺說

2130
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
婷音我不想要生了我又懷了第二胎了

2131
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
我要把他給打掉

2132
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
但是打胎在那個年代丈夫要簽字統一

2133
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
你給我簽字吧

2134
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
我爺爺是科學家打胎沒什麼大不了

2135
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
就不要就不要就簽了字

2136
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
把那個統一書寄回來

2137
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
又花了很長的時間好不容易寄到

2138
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
當時我爺爺的另外一個哥們叫楊家洛

2139
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
他也是一位近代的大學者

2140
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
楊家洛跟我爺爺非常非常要好

2141
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
當時他們在重慶住在舊近

2142
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
就住在附近

2143
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
他聽說這個我奶奶生財平

2144
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
要把第二胎剁胎

2145
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
他覺得這事情不太好吧

2146
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:48,000
所以這個楊奶奶就是楊家洛的母親

2147
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
楊家洛的尊夫人

2148
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
對不起他的母親

2149
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
這個太夫人

2150
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
他信佛信得非常虔誠

2151
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
他一聽就說不行就要做孽的

2152
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
所以就吩咐楊家洛

2153
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
無論如何你不能夠讓他去做這件事情

2154
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
不管你用什麼手段你要阻止他

2155
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
楊家洛也是一個書呆子

2156
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
他怎麼知道怎麼處理這種事情

2157
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
他就跑去找我奶奶

2158
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
然後就坐在客廳裡面

2159
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
半天找不出什麼話說

2160
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
最後就好不容易說不然你幫我弄杯咖啡好了

2161
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
我奶奶就進廚房去幫他燒水

2162
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
楊家洛就趕快翻桌子

2163
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
翻到這張同一書

2164
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
一把抓了就跑

2165
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
回到他自己家跟楊奶奶禀報

2166
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
楊奶奶就把那張剁胎同一書

2167
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
扔進爐子裡燒了

2168
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
我奶奶後來知道這件事

2169
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
他說有什麼大不了再寫一張吧

2170
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
但是來不及了

2171
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
因為這信件要再一來一回

2172
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
我奶奶肚子大到不能剁胎了

2173
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
只好生下來於是有了我父親

2174
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
要不是有這麼一段就不會有我了

2175
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:56,000
是

2176
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
後來我就

2177
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
我們的家族在台灣

2178
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
對奶奶的信息其實不是很清楚

2179
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
因為後來他們就離婚了

2180
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
我奶奶後來在大陸留下來

2181
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
她後來在嫁

2182
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
嫁給了張乃棄先生

2183
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
有當年棄君子之一的張乃棄

2184
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
那他跟張乃棄的婚姻

2185
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
有了張立凡先生

2186
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
所以我要叫張立凡老師

2187
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
叫叔叔

2188
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
那我爺爺呢在台灣

2189
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
他後來就透過這個

2190
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
介紹到日本相親

2191
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
又再娶娶了一個日本籍的女士

2192
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
所以我有一個日本奶奶

2193
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
那他又生了三個孩子

2194
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
我叫他們叔叔跟姑姑

2195
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
一直到1970年代

2196
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
我們兩岸開始通信

2197
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
才知道他還有一個未曾磨面的弟弟

2198
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
我爺爺在1979年的時候過世了

2199
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
我奶奶現在還在今年100歲

2200
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
1988年的時候

2201
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
我父親第一次到大陸探親

2202
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
那時候剛開放

2203
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
我叔叔去接他我奶奶去接他

2204
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
我父親非常擔心

2205
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
因為張立凡老師他是1949年生

2206
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
他跟共和國同齡

2207
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
我父親插指一算

2208
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
又就來得不要是個紅衛兵吧

2209
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
後來進了面

2210
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
進了家

2211
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
我父親看了一眼

2212
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
家裡面的書架

2213
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
我父親心中一塊大石頭放下了

2214
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
因為張立凡家裡的書

2215
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
跟我父親在台北書房的書

2216
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
有很多很多是重複的書

2217
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
張立凡老師那時候在

2218
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
社會科學研究院

2219
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
他的專長是中國近代史

2220
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
所以他們有非常非常多共同的話題

2221
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
他們有很多共同的近代史的書

2222
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
古籍的書文學的書

2223
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
他回來跟我說這些

2224
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
所以今天聽著前面幾位老師

2225
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
在說說民國

2226
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
我在想民國可能是什麼呢

2227
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
一部分可能就是在

2228
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
我這個家族曲折的歷史裡面

2229
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
有若干線索

2230
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
另外就是也許有一部分的答案

2231
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
他藏在我父親的書架上

2232
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
和張立凡先生的書架上那些書裡面吧

2233
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
這是我今天以一個晚輩的身份

2234
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
做一點小小的分享

2235
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
謝謝各位

2236
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
謝謝

2237
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
那麼接下來最後

2238
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
我們就請到陳丹清先生

2239
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
但陳丹清先生是有個講稿

2240
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
是要發給大家是吧

2241
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
是不發的

2242
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
好好好我們就有請陳丹清先生

2243
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:30,000
今天這個現場

2244
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
蠻有意思的

2245
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
也許同學們都知道

2246
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
隔壁就是東郊明巷

2247
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
八國聯軍來的時候

2248
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
很多早期的國民黨

2249
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
就往那兒逃

2250
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
然後馬路對過

2251
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
就是北京火車站

2252
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
大家知道不知道

2253
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
張作霖他們進入北京

2254
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
就是在那下車

2255
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
李鴻章進入北京

2256
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
然後1949年

2257
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
毛澤東帶著文武官員

2258
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
到火車站去迎接

2259
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
宋美林

2260
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
從上海到北京

2261
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
馬路對過

2262
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
現在這個火車站廢棄了

2263
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
不用了

2264
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
但建築還在

2265
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
再往西一點

2266
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
大家知道就是大前門

2267
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
我看過一張滿珍貴的照片

2268
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
1948年

2269
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
北平其實被包圍了一天

2270
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
不知道從什麼角度拍過去

2271
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
當時的天安門廣場還是荒草場

2272
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
可是大前門上都掛了

2273
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
一張蔣中正的照片

2274
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
巨大的照片

2275
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
黑白的照片

2276
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
我現在還留著

2277
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
那張歷史照片

2278
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
據說

2279
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
解放軍進城以後

2280
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
弄開國大典

2281
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
先前的選擇不是在天安門廣場

2282
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
是選擇大前門

2283
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
因為整個

2284
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
軍隊入城的儀式

2285
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
是由南向北

2286
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
經過現在天橋那邊

2287
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
往北走

2288
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
後來不知道怎樣

2289
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
就改成天安門

2290
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
所以我們小時候有一首歌叫

2291
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
我愛北京天安門

2292
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
如果當時選擇大前門

2293
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
就我愛北京大前門

2294
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000


2295
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
然後

2296
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
這個地方

2297
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
據我知道

2298
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
翁林尼要是我說錯了

2299
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
你就正我

2300
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
是民國時期的美國駐中國大使館

2301
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
領事館

2302
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
領事館

2303
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
那四圖雷登就在這上班嗎

2304
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
因為毛澤東

2305
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
有一篇很重要的文章

2306
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
叫別了四圖雷登

2307
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
意思就是

2308
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
咱們到此為止了

2309
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
所以當時四圖雷登

2310
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
可能還在這上班

2311
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
就在我們的上門

2312
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
不過今天我進來的時候

2313
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
軍警領利

2314
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
忽然明白這是靠天安門的地方

2315
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
靠天安門的地方都是要人緊張的地方

2316
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
所以我也有點緊張

2317
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
我想民國也有個

2318
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
有個所謂論壇

2319
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
我講得非常差

2320
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
因為我沒有準備

2321
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
我不太會繼續發言

2322
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
所以昨天匆忙寫了一下

2323
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
但是我把它想成發言15分鐘

2324
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
所以略微多了幾頁紙

2325
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
我可以把它壓縮的

2326
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
我盡快把它唸掉

2327
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
時間到了你提醒我

2328
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
我覺得這是個好話題

2329
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
民國是歷史還是現實

2330
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
但是如果記者問我

2331
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
我會答不上來

2332
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
因為現實和歷史這兩個詞不容易定義

2333
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
可能就是只過去了

2334
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
已經不在場了

2335
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
不奏效了

2336
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
可能就叫歷史

2337
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
可是現實就是說

2338
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
還在

2339
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
還有作用還在發生

2340
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
可能就現實

2341
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
講下去就會有點錯位

2342
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
跟民國這個概念

2343
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
我記得1966年文革爆發

2344
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
毛澤東狠狠的對全黨和全國人民說

2345
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
無產階級文化大革命

2346
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
是革命派和反革命

2347
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
共產黨和國民黨的繼續鬥爭

2348
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
那一年我13歲

2349
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
帶著紅領巾

2350
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
而且共和國也已經有17歲了

2351
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
我聽了毛澤東

2352
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
這麼一番話

2353
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
心驚肉條

2354
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
我想怎麼

2355
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
民國還沒有過去

2356
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
國民黨還在

2357
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
這是我小時候的印象

2358
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
現在我明白毛澤東

2359
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
其實沒有錯

2360
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
他那一年70多歲

2361
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
除了逃到台灣的那部分

2362
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
國民黨

2363
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
他的許多民國的朋友和敵人

2364
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
都還活著

2365
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
曾經頂撞過他的

2366
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
比方

2367
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
曾經殺過共產黨的李繼生

2368
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
都住在北京

2369
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
一大群民主人士

2370
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
第三勢力還有他的同志們

2371
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
而毛澤東本人

2372
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
包括周恩來 朱德

2373
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
一大夥共產黨領導

2374
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
曾經就是

2375
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
國民黨員

2376
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
在國民政府做官

2377
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
當著蔣介石的面喊

2378
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
蔣委員長萬歲

2379
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
所以毛澤東想起民國

2380
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
和我當年13歲一個小孩

2381
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
聽見民國

2382
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
感覺是不一樣的

2383
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
他一想起來就是一大群使他不安的活人

2384
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
1976年

2385
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
文革結束

2386
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
距今也整整35年了

2387
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
遠遠超過毛澤東

2388
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
回想民國的時間距離

2389
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
我們或者可以問

2390
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
文革是歷史還是現實

2391
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
30多年來

2392
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
我們的文人和出版社

2393
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
都在做歷史研究

2394
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
出歷史書

2395
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
在座諸位也想必喜歡獨歷史

2396
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
獨歷史為了什麼

2397
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
我想克羅奇說的那句話

2398
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
還沒過時

2399
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
所有的歷史都是當代史

2400
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
今年算是藉

2401
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
今年算是藉心害百年

2402
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
我們有一個理由在市面上

2403
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
公開說民國

2404
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
為了尊敬

2405
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
今年的另一個大的紀念

2406
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
我特地鑽到電影院

2407
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
去看了一場建黨大業

2408
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000


2409
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
看完以後

2410
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
手機就來了

2411
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
幾條短信

2412
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
其中有一條非常聰明

2413
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
把建黨和民國一塊紀念

2414
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
大家可能讀過這個短信

2415
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
我再念一遍

2416
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
建黨偉業是一部

2417
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
向北洋軍閥政府致敬的電影

2418
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
該片用生動的鏡頭

2419
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
精彩的案例

2420
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
溫馨的細節

2421
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
為我們描述了這樣一個時代

2422
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
報紙可以私人控股

2423
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
新聞可以批評政府

2424
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
大學可以學術獨立

2425
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
學生可以上街遊行

2426
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
群眾可以秘密結社

2427
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
警察不可隨便抓人

2428
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
權力有邊界

2429
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
法律有作用

2430
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
人權有保障

2431
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
窮人有貨路

2432
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
親眼有理想

2433
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000


2434
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
(拍手機)

2435
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
總之這部電影

2436
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
拍著拍著一不小心

2437
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
把部分民國史派出來了

2438
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
我猜製片人

2439
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
韓三平同志

2440
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
沒有想到這份效果

2441
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
嚴規正題

2442
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
雖然這條短信

2443
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
簡直已經回答了

2444
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
這個論壇的話題

2445
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
但我不能念一條短信交差

2446
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
所以趕緊清理我

2447
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
很可憐的歷史知識

2448
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
看看民國哪些往事

2449
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
已經過去了算是歷史

2450
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
哪些往事還在算是現實

2451
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
先說成為歷史的那個民國

2452
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
首先

2453
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
民國的戰亂過去

2454
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
我們幾代人何等幸福

2455
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
60年來沒有遭遇

2456
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
任何外敵侵略

2457
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
文革的舞鬥當然是

2458
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
毛澤東所說的繼續鬥爭

2459
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
但是死傷者

2460
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
沒有一個是國民黨員

2461
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
而是和在座一位一樣

2462
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
年輕的男女

2463
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
昨天聽秦輝

2464
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
先生說起廣西的舞鬥

2465
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
他親眼看到

2466
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
當時的高射炮

2467
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
平射和在越南用的

2468
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
炸藥彈

2469
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
當時他十幾歲

2470
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
舞鬥過後就清理現場

2471
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
大大的瓦利堆

2472
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
只要聞到臭味

2473
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
就可以崛起一個屍體

2474
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
但這個小意思跟民國的戰爭

2475
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
不能比了

2476
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
其次辦殖民地時代

2477
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
過去了

2478
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
帝國主義在中國的所有殖民區域

2479
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
完全消失

2480
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
雖然現在上海

2481
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
武漢

2482
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
南京 天津等市政府

2483
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
劫力刷新

2484
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
法租界 英租界

2485
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
但是像康有為

2486
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
梁啟超 胡適 魯迅

2487
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
這樣的闖禍配置

2488
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
再想鬧事就沒有地方

2489
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
可以躲了

2490
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
即便賴昌興遠遠的逃到加拿大

2491
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
還是乖乖的飛回來

2492
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
戴手套

2493
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
再其次中國的分裂

2494
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
過去了

2495
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
民國時期 或者先後或者同期

2496
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
有過南京政府

2497
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
有過武漢政府

2498
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
有過維加利安政府

2499
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
有過延安政府

2500
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
有過重慶政府

2501
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
還有過滿洲國

2502
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
東北的滿洲國

2503
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
有東山省的鐵路網

2504
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
忽然歸張作霖管

2505
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
忽然歸日本人管

2506
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
忽然歸蘇聯人管

2507
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
今天全國的鐵路

2508
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
暢通無阻

2509
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
新建的鐵路線和

2510
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
載客量是

2511
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
民國時期的幾十上百倍

2512
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
雖然最近發生

2513
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
動車追尾

2514
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
暴死幾十個人

2515
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
但成績絕對是主要的

2516
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
你們不相信嗎

2517
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
反正我是相信

2518
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000


2519
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
快點

2520
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
只有十分鐘

2521
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
再再其次

2522
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
國家的弱勢完全過去了

2523
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
民國政府

2524
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
根本沒有像樣的空軍和海軍

2525
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
要靠美國人和蘇聯

2526
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
人幫忙

2527
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
後來匆忙培養了

2528
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
自己的空軍飛行員

2529
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
幾乎在

2530
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
對日愛國

2531
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
保衛國家的空戰中

2532
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
全部死光

2533
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
我們的空軍非常棒

2534
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
都活著

2535
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
還駕駛飛船進入太空

2536
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
當然我們自己的航空母艦

2537
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
馬上要問世了

2538
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
此外民國的多黨政治

2539
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
徹底過去了

2540
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
我敢說的是

2541
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
民國教育的黃金時代

2542
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
完全過去了

2543
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
蔡元培的北大

2544
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
梅吉奇的清華

2545
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
張伯林的南開

2546
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
朱可珍的浙大

2547
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
絕對成為歷史

2548
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
一去不復範

2549
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
現在他們要是想當校長

2550
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
先得通過層層審查

2551
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
接著慢慢混到證局級

2552
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
或者副部級

2553
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
才能填寫申請表

2554
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
兩起抽言聘

2555
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
沒有學位的陳寅卻

2556
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
再也不能得場

2557
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
民國出版的

2558
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
自由和言論的自由

2559
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
也過去了

2560
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
像張元寄

2561
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
王雲武這樣的出版大亨

2562
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
再也不必

2563
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
辛辛苦苦自己開辦

2564
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
商務印書館之類

2565
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
邵飄平使良才

2566
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
這樣

2567
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
王命的記者和抱怨大王

2568
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
再也不會被槍斃

2569
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
被暗殺

2570
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
當今中國的出版商記者

2571
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
撰稿人一律享受

2572
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
新聞出版總署的保護

2573
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
非常安全 非常正確

2574
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
非常和諧

2575
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
所有人都很乖 很懂事

2576
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
絕對不怕被槍斃

2577
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000


2578
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
被暗殺

2579
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
最後一個可能被忽略的

2580
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
巨大事項

2581
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
也成為歷史

2582
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
那就是古文教育

2583
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
文言文和文白話文

2584
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
並成繁體字等等

2585
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
構成的漢語語言生態

2586
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
成為歷史了

2587
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
在民國所有失智的人

2588
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
既懂文言又懂白話文

2589
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
既用繁體字

2590
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
也用當時通行的簡體字

2591
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
隨著民國的消亡

2592
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
漢語的生態

2593
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
永遠消亡

2594
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
但是只有白話文

2595
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
只有簡體字

2596
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
民國的許許多多其他事物

2597
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
都成為歷史 永遠過去了

2598
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
一部分是歷史進程本身

2599
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
譬如現代化

2600
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
一部分是政治原因

2601
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
譬如無所不在的禁止

2602
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
但現於發言時間

2603
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
不能一一立舉

2604
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
現在我來快速立舉

2605
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
民國仍在今天奏效的部分現實

2606
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
譬如 據說

2607
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
民國的滅亡原因

2608
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
主要是貪污腐化

2609
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
全代關係

2610
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
今天所有被指控的

2611
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
民國腐敗者

2612
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
遠遠無法和共和國

2613
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
貪官筆

2614
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
從資料披露

2615
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
一向被認為巨貪的宋子文

2616
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
不但沒有怎麼貪污

2617
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
而且是個強硬的民主主義者

2618
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
就算他財富不很清楚

2619
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
但和今天隨便哪個

2620
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
被揭露的地方貪官相比

2621
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
簡直羞煞人

2622
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
當年為蔣介石

2623
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
負責運送

2624
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
黃金到台灣的一位

2625
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
老先生

2626
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
我忘了他的名字

2627
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
我在三連周看看到他的報導

2628
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
沒有貪污過一分錢

2629
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
臨死最後

2630
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
死了以後

2631
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
他的存責拿出來

2632
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
只有八萬美金

2633
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
至於群代關係

2634
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
不用我來說

2635
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
今日權力格局的血緣背景

2636
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
一點不比民國時期更細薄

2637
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
如果需要證據

2638
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
我希望學者做個統計

2639
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
民國社會層面

2640
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
世俗生活的部分狀況

2641
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
一度被鏟除

2642
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
之後近二十多年

2643
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
大規模捲土重來

2644
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
譬如色情業

2645
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
譬如賭博

2646
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
譬如走私

2647
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
譬如黑社會

2648
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
都在漸漸與民國接軌

2649
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
此外改革開放三十年

2650
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
途見被允許的

2651
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
拓展的空間

2652
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
都是民國生活型態的死灰富然

2653
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
譬如選美

2654
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
譬如時尚

2655
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
譬如娛樂 交際 享受 奢侈等等

2656
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
這些我認為都是好消息

2657
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
大家不要以為

2658
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
這是我們今天時代的

2659
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
稀罕事情

2660
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
民國時期早就有了

2661
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
這種活潑可喜的生活型態

2662
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
有的遠遠比民國時期土

2663
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
因為

2664
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
有教養的階層消失了

2665
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
有的遠遠比民國更陽

2666
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
因為民國人

2667
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
還沒機會領教西方

2668
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
二次現代化以後的種種

2669
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
性化樣

2670
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
時間關係 以上關於

2671
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
歷史與現實的類比

2672
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
十分粗糙 不準確 不可靠

2673
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
希望專家批評指教

2674
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
但是坦白的說

2675
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
我以為民國對於今天

2676
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
對於大部分年輕人

2677
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
既不是歷史

2678
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
為什麼 因為六十年來

2679
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
我們成功接受了

2680
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
空前成功的愚民教育

2681
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
這種教育的核心

2682
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
就是不要讓你知道過去

2683
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
直到你對過去莫不關心

2684
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
現在

2685
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
絕大部分中國人 尤其是年輕人

2686
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
沒有歷史感

2687
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
沒有現實感 對共和國

2688
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
不了解 更不了解民國

2689
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
三十年前

2690
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
鄧小平說過一句著名的話

2691
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
體育要從娃娃抓起

2692
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
其實真正要緊的是

2693
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
體育歷史要從娃娃抓起

2694
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
最近

2695
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
聽說秦輝他們

2696
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
在做大學生的

2697
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
一個調查 請大學生自己做

2698
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
題目叫

2699
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
你最熟悉的陌生人

2700
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
就是說 請今天的

2701
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
80後 90後

2702
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
像父母或者祖父母

2703
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
追問民國的往事

2704
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
這是瞭解民國最最有效

2705
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
最最人性的方式

2706
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
因為民國就在

2707
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
每個家庭

2708
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
剛才馬士芳就說了她的家庭

2709
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
我們大陸有很多這樣的家庭

2710
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
我的父母就是民國人

2711
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
祖爲的祖父母也是民國人

2712
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
就在你們家

2713
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
可是問到一半

2714
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
據說就有家長出來阻攔

2715
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
不要再問

2716
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
也不願再說

2717
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
為什麼 就是害怕歷史

2718
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
提醒現實

2719
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
因為今天的現實害怕歷史

2720
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
以致歷史也害怕今天

2721
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
因為民國的歷史

2722
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
就是國人

2723
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
所有民國的過來人

2724
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
迫於現實 迴避歷史

2725
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
不談歷史

2726
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
這就是我們今天的普遍的現實

2727
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
所以最熟悉的陌生人

2728
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
是個好題目

2729
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
你是爹媽生出來的

2730
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
你不了解爹媽

2731
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
中華人民共和國

2732
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
是民國生出來的

2733
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
可是共和國的老百姓

2734
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
不了解民國

2735
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
長期不了解

2736
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
不說就不會想了解

2737
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
不想說

2738
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
長期的不說

2739
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
幾代人不說

2740
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
等於沒有這回事

2741
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
這樣子不說 不說 不說

2742
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
每個家庭對孩子瞞著往事

2743
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
整個國家對人民

2744
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
也瞞著往事

2745
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
瞞的久了 30年

2746
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
60年瞞下來

2747
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
將來還會瞞下去

2748
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
那一個小青年

2749
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
或者小姑娘 你問她

2750
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
你要不要聽聽民國

2751
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
她掉頭就走

2752
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
她根本沒有興趣

2753
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
所以我覺得民國

2754
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
既不是歷史 也不是現實

2755
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
但是今天在座的年輕人

2756
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
比較不一樣

2757
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
大好秋天 哪裡不能去

2758
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
你們要跑到這裡來聽民國

2759
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
什麼意思呢

2760
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
但是你們還是來了

2761
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
謝謝大家

2762
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
謝謝

2763
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
謝謝

2764
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,560
(第四集)
